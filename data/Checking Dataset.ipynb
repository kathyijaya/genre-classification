In all other situations -- namely, eager mode and inside `tf.function` -- you can consume dataset elements using `for elem in dataset: ...` or by explicitly creating iterator via `iterator = iter(dataset)` and fetching its elements via `values = next(iterator)`. Furthermore, this API is not available in TF 2. During the transition from TF 1 to TF 2 you can use `tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator(dataset)` to create a TF 1 graph mode style iterator for a dataset created through TF 2 APIs. Note that this should be a transient state of your code base as there are in general no guarantees about the interoperability of TF 1 and TF 2 code.\n"

and the conclusion at which he arrived\\r\\nwas that there is \"something of egotism and even of pedantry in this\\r\\nsentiment.\" it is a true saying in literature as in morality that \"he\\r\\nthat seeketh his life shall lose it.\" the world cares most for those who\\r\\nhave cared least for the world\\'s applause. a nameless minstrel of the\\r\\nnorth country sings a ballad that shall stir men\\'s hearts from age to\\r\\nage with haunting melody; southey, toiling at his epics, is excluded\\r\\nfrom parnassus. some there are who have knocked at the door of the\\r\\ntemple of fame, and have been admitted at once and for ever. when\\r\\nthucydides announced that he intended his history to be a \"possession\\r\\nfor all time,\" there was no mistaking the tone of authority. but to be\\r\\nenthroned in state, to receive the homage of the admiring multitude, and\\r\\nthen to be rejected as a pretender,--that is indeed a sorry fate, and\\r\\none that may well make us pause before envying literary despots their\\r\\ntitles. the more closely a writer shrouds himself from view, the more\\r\\neager are his readers to get a sight of him. the loss of an arm or a leg\\r\\nwould be a slight price for a genuine student to pay if only he could\\r\\ndiscover one new fact about shakespeare\\'s history. i will not attempt to\\r\\nimpose on the reader\\'s credulity by professing myself eager to acquire\\r\\ninformation about the author of \"peter wilkins\" at such a sacrifice; but\\r\\nit would have been a sincere pleasure to me if i could have brought to\\r\\nlight some particulars about one whose personality must have possessed\\r\\na more than ordinary charm. the delightful _voyage imaginaire_ here\\r\\npresented to the reader was first published in 1751.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     * some copies are said to be dated 1750. it appears on the\\r\\n     list of new books announced in the \"gentleman\\'s magazine\"\\r\\n     for november 1750.\\r\\n\\r\\nan edition appeared immediately afterwards at dublin; so the book must\\r\\nhave had some sale. the introduction and the dedication to the countess\\r\\nof northumberland (to whom it will be remembered percy dedicated his\\r\\n\"reliques\" and goldsmith the first printed copy of his \"edwin and\\r\\nangelina\") are signed with the initials \"r. p.;\" and for many years the\\r\\nauthor\\'s full name was unknown. in 1835, nicol, the printer, sold by\\r\\nauction a number of books and manuscripts in his possession, which\\r\\nhad once belonged to dodsley, the publisher; and when these were being\\r\\ncatalogued, the original agreement * for the sale of the ms. of \"peter\\r\\nwilkins\" was brought to light.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * it is now in the collection, shortly to be dispersed, of\\r\\n     the late mr. james crossley of manchester, a gentleman who\\r\\n     was esteemed throughout his long life not less for unfailing\\r\\n     courtesy than for rare scholarship. mr. crossley promised to\\r\\n     search for the document and send me a transcript of it; but\\r\\n     his kind intention was frustrated by his death. paltock\\'s\\r\\n     name is sometimes written pultock or poltock. there is no\\r\\n     ground for identifying the author of \"peter wilkins\" with\\r\\n     the \"r. p., gent.,\" who published in 1751 \"memoirs of the\\r\\n     life of parnese, a spanish lady, translated from the spanish\\r\\n     ms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom this document it appeared that the author was robert paltock of\\r\\nclement\\'s inn, and that he received for the copyright 20l., twelve\\r\\ncopies of the book, and \"the cuts of the first impression\"(proof\\r\\nimpressions of the illustrations). the writer\\'s name shows him to have\\r\\nbeen, like his hero, of cornish origin; but the authors of the admirable\\r\\nand exhaustive \"bibliotheca cornubiensis\" could discover nothing about\\r\\nhim beyond the fact that he was not a bencher of clement\\'s inn. that\\r\\npaltock should have chosen clement\\'s inn as a place of residence is\\r\\nnot surprising. it still keeps something of its pristine repose. the\\r\\nsun-dial is still supported by the negro; the grass has not lost its\\r\\nverdure, and on august evenings the plane-trees\\' leaves glint golden\\r\\nin the sun. one may still hear the chimes at midnight as falstaff and\\r\\njustice shallow heard them of old. here, where only a muffled murmur\\r\\ncomes from the work-a-day world, a man in the last century might have\\r\\ndreamed away his life, lonely as peter wilkins on the island. one can\\r\\nimagine the amiable recluse composing his homely romance amid such\\r\\nsurroundings. perhaps it was the one labour of his life. he may have\\r\\ncome to the inn originally with the aspiration of making fame and money;\\r\\nand then the spirit of cloistered calm turned him from such vulgar\\r\\npaths, and instead of losing his fine feelings and swelling the ranks of\\r\\nthe plutocrats, he gave us a charming romance for our fireside. with\\r\\nthe literary men of his day he seems to have had no intercourse. not a\\r\\nsingle mention of him is to be found among his contemporaries, and\\r\\nwe may be sure that he cut no brilliant figure at the club-houses. no\\r\\nchorus of reviewers chimed the praises of \"peter wilkins.\" so far as\\r\\ni can discover, the \"monthly review\" was the only journal in which the\\r\\nbook was noticed, and such criticism as the following can hardly be\\r\\ntermed laudatory:--\"here is a very strange performance indeed. it seems\\r\\nto be the illegitimate offspring of no very natural conjunction, like\\r\\n\\'gulliver\\'s travels\\' and \\'robinson crusoe;\\' but much inferior to the\\r\\nmanner of these two performances as to entertainment or utility. it has\\r\\nall that is impossible in the one or impossible in the other, without\\r\\nthe wit and spirit of the first, or the just strokes of nature and\\r\\nuseful lessons of morality in the second. however, if the invention of\\r\\nwings for mankind to fly with is sufficient amends for all the dulness\\r\\nand unmeaning extravagance of the author, we are willing to allow that\\r\\nhis book has some merit, and that he deserves some encouragement at\\r\\nleast as an able mechanic, if not as a good author.\" but the book\\r\\nwas not forgotten. a new edition appeared in 1783, and again in the\\r\\nfollowing year. it was included in weber\\'s \"popular romances,\" 1812, and\\r\\npublished separately, with some charming plates by stothard, in 1816.\\r\\nwithin the last fifty years it has been frequently issued, entire or\\r\\nmutilated, in a popular form. a drama founded on the romance was acted\\r\\nat covent garden on april 16, 1827; and more than once of late years\\r\\n\"peter wilkins\" has afforded material for pantomimes. in 1763 a french\\r\\ntranslation (by philippe florent de puisieux) appeared under the title\\r\\nof \"les hommes volants, ou les aventures de pierre wilkins,\" which was\\r\\nincluded in vols. xxii.-xxiii. of deperthe\\'s \"voyages imaginaires\" (\\r\\n1788-89). a german translation was published in 1767, having for title\\r\\n\"die fliegenden menschen, oder wunderbare begebenheiten peter wilkins.\"\\r\\nwhether the author lived to see the translations of this work cannot\\r\\nbe ascertained. a robert paltock was buried at ryme intrinseca church,\\r\\ndorset, in 1767, aged seventy (hutchin\\'s \"dorset,\" iv. 493-494, third\\r\\nedition), but it is very doubtful whether he was the author of the\\r\\nromance.\\r\\n\\r\\npaltock\\'s fame may be said to be firmly established. an american writer,\\r\\nit is true, in a recent \"history of fiction,\" says not a word about\\r\\n\"peter wilkins;\" but, we must remember, another american wrote a\\r\\n\"history of caricature\" without mentioning rowlandson. coleridge admired\\r\\nthe book, and is reported to have said: \"peter wilkins is, to my mind, a\\r\\nwork of uncommon beauty.... i believe that \\'robinson crusoe\\' and \\'peter\\r\\nwilkins\\' could only have been written by islanders. no continentalist\\r\\ncould have conceived either tale.... it would require a very peculiar\\r\\ngenius to add another tale _ejusdem generis_ to \\'robinson crusoe\\' and\\r\\n\\'peter wilkins.\\' i once projected such a thing, but the difficulty of\\r\\nthe preoccupied ground stopped me. perhaps la motte fouque might effect\\r\\nsomething; but i should fear that neither he nor any other german could\\r\\nentirely understand what may be called the _desert island_ feeling.\\r\\ni would try the marvellous line of \\'peter wilkins\\' if i attempted it\\r\\nrather than the real fiction of \\'robinson crusoe\\'\" (\"table-talk,\" 1851,\\r\\npp. 331-332). southey, in a note on a passage of the \"curse of kehama,\"\\r\\nwent so far as to say that paltock\\'s winged people \"are the most\\r\\nbeautiful creatures of imagination that ever were devised,\" and added\\r\\nthat sir walter scott was a warm admirer of the book. with charles lamb\\r\\nat christ\\'s hospital the story was a favourite. \"we had classics of our\\r\\nown,\" he says, \"without being beholden to \\'insolent greece or haughty\\r\\nrome,\\' that passed current among us--\\'peter wilkins,\\' the \\'adventures of\\r\\nthe hon. captain robert boyle,\\' the \\'fortunate blue-coat boy,\\' and the\\r\\nlike.\" but nobody loved the old romance with such devotion as leigh\\r\\nhunt. he was never tired of discoursing about its beauties, and he wrote\\r\\nwith such thorough appreciation of his subject that he left little or\\r\\nnothing for another to add. \"it is interesting,\" he writes in one place,\\r\\n\"to fancy r. p., or \\'mr. robert paltock of clement\\'s inn,\\' a gentle\\r\\nlover of books, not successful enough, perhaps, as a barrister to lead a\\r\\npublic or profitable life, but eking out a little employment or a bit\\r\\nof a patrimony with literature congenial to him, and looking oftener\\r\\nto \\'purchase pilgrims\\' on his shelves than to \\'coke on littleton.\\' we\\r\\npicture him to ourselves with \\'robinson crusoe\\' on one side of him and\\r\\n\\'gaudentio di lucca\\' on the other, hearing the pen go over his paper\\r\\nin one of those quiet rooms in clement\\'s inn that look out of its\\r\\nold-fashioned buildings into the little garden with the dial in it held\\r\\nby the negro: one of the prettiest corners in london, and extremely fit\\r\\nfor a sequestered fancy that cannot get any further. there he sits,\\r\\nthe unknown, ingenious, and amiable mr. robert paltock, thinking of an\\r\\nimaginary beauty for want of a better, and creating her for the delight\\r\\nof posterity, though his contemporaries were to know little or nothing\\r\\nof her. we shall never go through the place again without regarding him\\r\\nas its crowning interest.... now a sweeter creature [than youwarkee] is\\r\\nnot to be found in books; and she does him immortal honour. she is all\\r\\ntenderness and vivacity; all born good taste and blessed companionship.\\r\\nher pleasure consists but in his; she prevents all his wishes; has\\r\\nneither prudery nor immodesty; sheds not a tear but from right feeling;\\r\\nis the good of his home and the grace of his fancy. it has been well\\r\\nobserved that the author has not made his flying women in general light\\r\\nand airy enough... and it may be said, on the other hand, that the\\r\\nkind of wing, the graundee, or elastic drapery which opens and shuts\\r\\nat pleasure, however ingeniously and even beautifully contrived, would\\r\\nnecessitate creatures whose modifications of humanity, bodily and\\r\\nmental, though never so good after their kind, might have startled the\\r\\ninventor had he been more of a naturalist; might have developed a being\\r\\nvery different from the feminine, sympathising, and lovely youwarkee.\\r\\nmuscles and nerves not human must have been associated with inhuman\\r\\nwants and feelings; probably have necessitated talons and a beak! at\\r\\nbest the woman would have been wilder, more elvish, capricious, and\\r\\nunaccountable. she would have ruffled her whalebones when angry; been\\r\\nhorribly intimate, perhaps, with birds\\' nests and fights with eagles;\\r\\nand frightened wilkins out of his wits with dashing betwixt rocks and\\r\\npulling the noses of seals and gulls. (\"book for a corner,\" 1868, i. 68,\\r\\n&c.) could criticism be more delightful? but in the \"london journal,\"\\r\\nnovember 5, 1834, the genial essayist\\'s fancy dallied even more daintily\\r\\nwith the theme: \"a peacock with his plumage displayed, full of \\'rainbows\\r\\nand starry eyes,\\' is a fine object, but think of a lovely woman set in\\r\\nfront of an ethereal shell and wafted about like a venus.... we are to\\r\\npicture to ourselves a nymph in a vest of the finest texture and most\\r\\ndelicate carnation. on a sudden this drapery parts in two and flies\\r\\nback, stretched from head to foot like an oval fan or an umbrella; and\\r\\nthe lady is in front of it, preparing to sweep blushing away from us and\\r\\n\\'winnow the buxom air.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nfor many of us the conduct of life is becoming evermore a thing of\\r\\ngreater perplexity. it is wearisome to be rudely jostling one another\\r\\nfor the world\\'s prizes, while myriads are toiling round us in an\\r\\negyptian bondage unlit by one ray of sunshine from the cradle to the\\r\\ngrave. some have attained to lucretian heights of philosophy, whence\\r\\nthey look with indifference over the tossing world-wide sea of human\\r\\nmisery; but others are fain to avert their eyes, to clean forget for a\\r\\nseason the actual world and lose themselves in the mazes of romance. in\\r\\nmoments of despondency there is no greater relief to a fretted spirit\\r\\nthan to turn to the \"odyssey\" or mr. payne\\'s exquisite translation of\\r\\nthe \"arabian nights.\" great should be our gratitude to mr. morris for\\r\\nteaching us in golden verse that \"love is enough,\" and for spreading\\r\\nwide the gates of his \"earthly paradise.\" lucian\\'s \"true history,\" that\\r\\ncarries us over unknown seas beyond the atlantic bounds to enchanted\\r\\nislands in the west, is one of those books which we do not half\\r\\nappreciate. and among the world\\'s benefactors robert paltock deserves a\\r\\nplace. an idle hour could not be spent in a much pleasanter way than in\\r\\nwatching peter wilkins go a-field with his gun or haul up the beast-fish\\r\\nat the lonely creek. what can be more delightful than the description\\r\\nhow, wakened from dreams of home by the noise of strange voices\\r\\noverhead, he sees fallen at his door the lovely winged woman youwarkee!\\r\\nprudish people may be scandalised at the unreserved frankness shown\\r\\nin the account of the consummation of wilkins\\' marriage with this fair\\r\\ncreature; but the editor was unwilling to mutilate the book in the\\r\\ninterests of such refined readers. a man or a woman who can find\\r\\nanything to shock his or her feelings in the description of youwarkee\\'s\\r\\nbridal night deserves the commiseration of sensible people. very\\r\\ncharming is the picture of the children sitting round the fire on the\\r\\nlong winter evenings listening wide-eyed to the ever-fresh story of\\r\\ntheir father\\'s marvellous adventures. the wholesome morality, the\\r\\ncharitableness and homely piety apparent throughout, give the narrative\\r\\na charm denied to many works of greater literary pretension. when peter\\r\\nwilkins leaves his solitary home to live among the winged people, the\\r\\ninterest of the story, it must be confessed, is somewhat diminished.\\r\\nthe author\\'s obligations to swift in the latter part of the book are\\r\\nconsiderable; and of course in describing how peter wilkins ordered his\\r\\nlife on the lonely island, he was largely indebted to defoe. but the\\r\\ncreation of the winged beings is paltock\\'s own. it has been suggested\\r\\nthat he named his hero after john wilkins, bishop of chester, who, among\\r\\nother curious theories, had seriously discussed the question whether men\\r\\ncould acquire the art of flying. in the second part of his \"mathematical\\r\\nmagick,\" the bishop writes: \"those things that seem very difficult\\r\\nand fearfull at the first may grow very facil after frequent trial and\\r\\nexercise: and therefore he that would effect any thing in this kind\\r\\nmust be brought up to the constant practice of it from his youth; trying\\r\\nfirst only to use his wings in running on the ground, as an estrich or\\r\\ntame geese will do, touching the earth with his toes; and so by degrees\\r\\nlearn to rise higher till he shall attain unto skill and confidence.\\r\\ni have heard it from credible testimony that one of our nation hath\\r\\nproceeded so far in this experiment that he was able by the help of\\r\\nwings to skip constantly ten yards at a time.\" youwarkee spread wide her\\r\\ngraundee, and in an instant was lost in the clouds. had the author given\\r\\nher the motion of a goose, or even of an ostrich--bah! the thought is\\r\\ntoo dreadful.\\r\\n\\r\\njudicious reader, the long winter evenings have come round, and you have\\r\\nnow abundance of leisure. let the poets stand idle on the shelves\\r\\ntill the return of spring, unless perchance you would fain resume\\r\\nacquaintance with the \"seasons,\" which you have not read since a boy,\\r\\nor would divert yourself with prior or be grave with crabbe. now is the\\r\\ntime to feel once more the charm of lamb\\'s peerless and unique essays;\\r\\nnow is the time to listen to the honied voice of leigh hunt discoursing\\r\\ndaintily of men and books. so you will pass from charles lamb and leigh\\r\\nhunt to the books they loved to praise. exult in the full-blooded,\\r\\nbracing life which pulses in the pages of fielding; and if smollett\\'s\\r\\nmirth is occasionally too riotous and his taste too coarse, yet confess\\r\\nthat all faults must be pardoned to the author of \"humphry clinker.\"\\r\\nmany a long evening you will spend pleasantly with defoe; and then,\\r\\nperchance, after a fresh reading of the thrice and four times wonderful\\r\\nadventures of robinson crusoe, you will turn to the romance of \"peter\\r\\nwilkins.\" so may rheums and catarrhs be far from you, and may your\\r\\nhearth be crowned with content!\\r\\n\\r\\na. h. b.\\r\\n\\r\\n5 willow road,

any of my own concerns,\\r\\nor the affairs that led me into the south seas. therefore i shall only\\r\\nacquaint him, that in my return on board the \"hector,\" as a passenger,\\r\\nround cape horn, for england, full late in the season, the wind and\\r\\ncurrents setting strong against us, our ship drove more southernly, by\\r\\nseveral degrees, than the usual course, even to the latitude of 75 or\\r\\n76; when the wind chopping about, we began to resume our intended\\r\\nway. it was about the middle of june, when the days are there at the\\r\\nshortest, on a very starry and moonlight night, that we observed at some\\r\\ndistance a very black cloud, but seemingly of no extraordinary size or\\r\\nheight, moving very fast towards us, and seeming to follow the ship,\\r\\nwhich then made great way. every one on deck was very curious in\\r\\nobserving its motions; and perceiving it frequently to divide, and\\r\\npresently to close again, and not to continue long in any determined\\r\\nshape, our captain, who had never before been so far to the southward as\\r\\nhe then found himself, had many conjectures what this phenomenon might\\r\\nportend; and every one offering his own opinion, it seemed at last to be\\r\\ngenerally agreed that there might possibly be a storm gathering in the\\r\\nair, of which this was the prognostic; and by its following, and nearly\\r\\nkeeping pace with us, we were in great fear lest it should break upon\\r\\nand overwhelm us, if not carefully avoided. our commander, therefore,\\r\\nas it approached nearer and nearer, ordered one of the ship\\'s guns to be\\r\\nfired, to try if the percussion of the air would disperse it. this was\\r\\nno sooner done than we heard a prodigious flounce in the water, at but\\r\\na small distance from the ship, on the weather-quarter; and after\\r\\na violent noise, or cry in the air, the cloud, that upon our firing\\r\\ndissipated, seemed to return again, but by degrees disappeared. whilst\\r\\nwe were all very much surprised at this unexpected accident, i, being\\r\\nnaturally very curious and inquisitive into the causes of all unusual\\r\\nincidents, begged the captain to send the boat to see, if possible, what\\r\\nit was that had fallen from the cloud, and offered myself to make one in\\r\\nher. he was much against this at first, as it would retard his voyage,\\r\\nnow we were going so smoothly before the wind. but in the midst of\\r\\nour debate, we plainly heard a voice calling out for help, in our own\\r\\ntongue, like a person in great distress. i then insisted on going, and\\r\\nnot suffering a fellow-creature to perish for the sake of a trifling\\r\\ndelay. in compliance with my resolute demand, he slackened sail; and\\r\\nhoisting out the boat, myself and seven others made to the cry, and soon\\r\\nfound it to come from an elderly man, labouring for life, with his arms\\r\\nacross several long poles, of equal size at both ends, very light, and\\r\\ntied to each other in a very odd manner. the sailors at first were very\\r\\nfearful of assisting or coming near him, crying to each other, \"he must\\r\\nbe a monster!\" and perhaps might overset the boat and destroy them; but\\r\\nhearing him speak english, i was very angry with them for their foolish\\r\\napprehensions, and caused them to clap their oars under him, and at\\r\\nlength we got him into the boat. he had an extravagant beard, and also\\r\\nlong blackish hair upon his head. as soon as he could speak (for he\\r\\nwas almost spent), he very familiarly took me by the hand, i having set\\r\\nmyself close by him to observe him, and squeezing it, thanked me very\\r\\nkindly for my civility to him, and likewise thanked all the sailors. i\\r\\nthen asked him by what possible accident he came there; but he shook\\r\\nhis head, declining to satisfy my curiosity. hereupon reflecting that it\\r\\nmight just then be troublesome for him to speak, and that we should\\r\\nhave leisure enough in our voyage for him to relate, and me to hear, his\\r\\nstory (which, from the surprising manner of his falling amongst us, i\\r\\ncould not but believe would contain something very remarkable), i waived\\r\\nany farther speech with him at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had him to the ship, and taking off his wet clothes, put him to bed\\r\\nin my cabin; and i having a large provision of stores on board, and\\r\\nno concern in the ship, grew very fond of him, and supplied him with\\r\\neverything he wanted. in our frequent discourses together, he had\\r\\nseveral times dropped loose hints of his past transactions, which but\\r\\nthe more inflamed me with impatience to hear the whole of them. about\\r\\nthis time, having just begun to double the cape, our captain thought of\\r\\nwatering at the first convenient place; and finding the stranger had no\\r\\nmoney to pay his passage, and that he had been from england no less than\\r\\nthirty-five years, despairing of his reward for conducting him thither,\\r\\nhe intimated to him that he must expect to be put on shore to shift for\\r\\nhimself, when we put in for water. this entirely sunk the stranger\\'s\\r\\nspirits, and gave me great concern, insomuch that i fully resolved, if\\r\\nthe captain should really prove such a brute, to take the payment of his\\r\\npassage on myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nas we came nearer to the destined watering, the captain spoke the\\r\\nplainer of his intentions (for i had not yet hinted my design to him\\r\\nor any one else); and one morning the stranger came into my cabin, with\\r\\ntears in his eyes, telling me he verily believed the captain would be\\r\\nas good as his word, and set him on shore, which he very much dreaded.\\r\\ni did not choose to tell him immediately what i designed in his favour,\\r\\nbut asked him if he could think of no way of satisfying the captain,\\r\\nor any one else, who might thereupon be induced to engage for him; and\\r\\nfarther, how he expected to live when he should get to england, a man\\r\\nquite forgotten and penniless. hereupon he told me he had, ever since\\r\\nhis being on board, considering his destitute condition, entertained a\\r\\nthought of having his adventures written; which, as there was something\\r\\nso uncommon in them, he was sure the world would be glad to know; and he\\r\\nhad flattered himself with hopes of raising somewhat by the sale of them\\r\\nto put him in a way of living; but as it was plain now he should never\\r\\nsee england without my assistance, if i would answer for his passage,\\r\\nand write his life, he would communicate to me a faithful narrative\\r\\nthereof, which he believed would pay me to the full any charge i might\\r\\nbe at on his account. i was very well pleased with this overture, not\\r\\nfrom the prospect of gain by the copy, but from the expectation i had of\\r\\nbeing fully satisfied in what i had so long desired to know; so i told\\r\\nhim i would make him easy in that respect. this quite transported\\r\\nhim: he caressed me, and called me his deliverer, and was then going\\r\\nopen-mouthed to the captain to tell him so. but i put a stop to that:\\r\\nfor, says i, though i insist upon hearing your story, the captain may\\r\\nyet relent of his purpose, and not leave you on shore; and if that\\r\\nshould prove the case, i shall neither part with my money for you, nor\\r\\nyou with your interest in your adventures to me. whereupon he agreed i\\r\\nwas right, and desisted.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we had taken in best part of our water, and the boat was going its\\r\\nlast turn, the captain ordered up the strange man, as they called him,\\r\\nand told him he must go on board the boat, which was to leave him on\\r\\nshore with some few provisions. i happening to hear nothing of these\\r\\norders, they were so sudden, the poor man was afraid, after all, he\\r\\nshould have been hurried to land without my knowledge: but begging very\\r\\nhard of the captain only for leave to speak with me before he went, i\\r\\nwas called (though with some reluctance, for the captain disliked me\\r\\nfor the liberties i frequently took with him, on account of his brutal\\r\\nbehaviour). i expostulated with the cruel wretch on the inhumanity of\\r\\nthe action he was about; telling him, if he had resolved the poor man\\r\\nshould perish, it would have been better to have suffered him to do so\\r\\nwhen he was at the last extremity, than to expose him afresh, by this\\r\\nmeans, to a death as certain, in a more lingering and miserable way. but\\r\\nthe savage being resolved, and nothing moved by what i said, i paid him\\r\\npart of the passage down, and agreed to pay the rest at our arrival in\\r\\nengland.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus having reprieved the poor man, the next thing was to enter upon my\\r\\nnew employ of amanuensis: and having a long space of time before us,\\r\\nwe allotted two hours every morning for the purpose of writing down his\\r\\nlife from his own mouth; and frequently, when wind and weather kept us\\r\\nbelow, we spent some time of an afternoon in the same exercise, till\\r\\nwe had quite completed it. but then there were some things in it so\\r\\nindescribable by words, that if i had not had some knowledge in drawing,\\r\\nour history had been very incomplete. thus it must have been, especially\\r\\nin the description of the _glumms_ and _gawrys_ therein mentioned. in\\r\\norder to gain (that so i might communicate) a clear idea of these, i\\r\\nmade several drawings of them from his discourses and accounts; and,\\r\\nat length, after divers trials, i made such exact delineations, that\\r\\nhe declared they could not have been more perfect resemblances if i had\\r\\ndrawn them from the life. upon a survey, he confessed the very persons\\r\\nthemselves could not have been more exact. i also drew with my pencil\\r\\nthe figure of an aerial engagement, which, having likewise had his\\r\\napprobation, i have given a draught of, plate the sixth.\\r\\n\\r\\nthen, having finished the work to our mutual satisfaction, i locked it\\r\\nup, in order to peruse it at leisure, intending to have presented it to\\r\\nhim at our arrival in england, to dispose of as he pleased, in such\\r\\na way as might have conduced most to his profit; for i resolved,\\r\\nnotwithstanding our agreement, and the obligations he was under to\\r\\nme, that the whole of that should be his own. but he, having been in a\\r\\ndeclining state some time before we reached shore, died the very night\\r\\nwe landed; and his funeral falling upon me, i thought i had the greatest\\r\\nright to the manuscript, which, however, i had no design to have parted\\r\\nwith; but showing it to some judicious friends, i have by them been\\r\\nprevailed with not to conceal from the world what may prove so very\\r\\nentertaining, and perhaps useful.\\r\\n\\r\\nr. p.\\r\\n\\r\\na genuine account\\r\\n\\r\\nof the\\r\\n\\r\\nlife of peter wilkins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter i.\\r\\n\\r\\ngiving an account of the author\\'s birth and family--the fondness of\\r\\nhis mother--his being put to an academy at sixteen by the advice of his\\r\\nfriend--his thoughts of his own illiterature\\r\\n\\r\\ni was born at penhale, in the county of cornwall, on the 21st day of\\r\\ndecember 1685, about four months after my father, peter wilkins, who\\r\\nwas a zealous protestant of the church of england, had been executed\\r\\nby jeffreys, in somersetshire, for joining in the design of raising the\\r\\nduke of monmouth to the british throne. i was named, after my father and\\r\\ngrandfather, peter, and was my father\\'s only child by alice his wife,\\r\\nthe daughter of john capert, a clergyman in a neighbouring village. my\\r\\ngrandfather was a shopkeeper at newport, who, by great frugality and\\r\\nextraordinary application, had raised a fortune of about l160 a year\\r\\nin lands, and a considerable sum of ready money, all which at his\\r\\ndeath devolved upon my father, as his only child; who, being no less\\r\\nparsimonious than my grandfather, and living upon his own estate, had\\r\\nmuch improved it in value before his marriage with my mother; but he\\r\\ncoming to that unhappy end, my mother, after my birth, placed all her\\r\\naffection upon me (her growing hope, as she called me), and used every\\r\\nmethod, in my minority, of increasing the store for my benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\nin this manner she went on, till i grew too big, as i thought, for\\r\\nconfinement at the apron-string, being then about fourteen years of age;\\r\\nand having met with so much indulgence from her, for that reason found\\r\\nvery little or no contradiction from anybody else; so i looked on myself\\r\\nas a person of some consequence, and began to take all opportunities of\\r\\nenjoying the company of my neighbours, who hinted frequently that the\\r\\nrestraint i was under was too great a curb upon an inclination like\\r\\nmine of seeing the world; but my mother, still impatient of any little\\r\\nabsence, by excessive fondness, and encouraging every inclination i\\r\\nseemed to have, when she could be a partaker with me, kept me within\\r\\nbounds of restraint till i arrived at my sixteenth year.\\r\\n\\r\\nabout this time i got acquainted with a country gentleman, of a small\\r\\npaternal estate, which had been never the better for being in his hands,\\r\\nand had some uneasy demands upon it. he soon grew very fond of me,\\r\\nhoping, as i had reason afterwards to believe, by a union with my\\r\\nmother to set himself free from his entanglements. she was then about\\r\\nthirty-five years old, and still continued my father\\'s widow, out\\r\\nof particular regard to me, as i have all the reason in the world to\\r\\nbelieve. she was really a beautiful woman, and of a sanguine complexion,\\r\\nbut-had always carried herself with so much reserve, and given so little\\r\\nencouragement to any of the other sex, that she had passed her widowhood\\r\\nwith very few solicitations to alter her way of life. this gentleman\\r\\nobserving my mother\\'s conduct, in order to ingratiate himself with her,\\r\\nhad shown numberless instances of regard for me; and, as he told my\\r\\nmother, had observed many things in my discourse, actions, and turn of\\r\\nmind, that presaged wonderful expectations from me, if my genius was but\\r\\nproperly cultivated.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis discourse, from a man of very good parts, and esteemed by everybody\\r\\nan accomplished gentleman, by degrees wrought upon my mother, and more\\r\\nand more inflamed her with a desire of adding what lustre she could to\\r\\nmy applauded abilities, and influenced her so far as to ask his advice\\r\\nin what manner most properly to proceed with me. my gentleman then had\\r\\nhis desire, for he feared not the widow, could he but properly dispose\\r\\nof her charge; so having desired a little time to consider of a matter\\r\\nof such importance, he soon after told her he thought the most useful\\r\\nmethod of establishing me would be at an academy, kept by a very worthy\\r\\nand judicious gentleman, about thirty, or more, miles from us, in\\r\\nsomersetshire; where, if i could but be admitted, the master taking in\\r\\nbut a stated number of students at a time, he did not in the least doubt\\r\\nbut i should fully answer the character he had given her of me, and\\r\\noutshine most of my contemporaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy mother, over-anxious for my good, seeming to listen to this proposal,\\r\\nmy friend (as i call him) proposed taking a journey himself to the\\r\\nacademy, to see if any place was vacant for my reception, and learn the\\r\\nterms of my admission; and in three days\\' time returned with an engaging\\r\\naccount of the place, the master, the regularity of the scholars, of an\\r\\napartment secured for my reception, and, in short, whatever else might\\r\\ncaptivate my mother\\'s opinion in favour of his scheme; and indeed,\\r\\nthough he acted principally from another motive, as was plain\\r\\nafterwards, i cannot help thinking he believed it to be the best way of\\r\\ndisposing of a lad sixteen years old, born to a pretty fortune, and who,\\r\\nat that age, could but just read a chapter in the testament; for he had\\r\\nbefore beat my mother quite out of her inclination to a grammar-school\\r\\nin the neighbourhood, from a contempt, he said, it would bring upon\\r\\nme from lads much my juniors in years, by being placed in the first\\r\\nrudiments of learning with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nwell, the whole concern of my mother\\'s little family was now employed\\r\\nin fitting me out for my expedition; and as my friend had been so\\r\\ninstrumental in bringing it about, he never missed a day inquiring\\r\\nhow preparations went on; and during the process, by humouring me,\\r\\ningratiated himself more and more with my mother, but without seeming in\\r\\nthe least to aim at it. in short, the hour of my departure arrived; and\\r\\nthough i had never been master of above a sixpence at one time, unless\\r\\nat a fair or so, for immediate spending, my mother, thinking to make my\\r\\nheart easy at our separation (which, had it appeared otherwise, would\\r\\nhave broke hers, and spoiled all), gave me a double pistole in gold, and\\r\\na little silver in my pocket to prevent my changing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus i (the coach waiting for us at the door), having been preached into\\r\\na good liking of the scheme by my friend, who now insisted upon making\\r\\none of our company to introduce us, mounted the carriage with more\\r\\nalacrity than could be expected for one who had never before been beyond\\r\\nthe smoke of his mother\\'s chimney; but the thoughts i had conceived,\\r\\nfrom my friend\\'s discourse, of liberty in the academic way, and the\\r\\nweight of so much money in my pocket, as i then imagined would scarce\\r\\never be exhausted, were prevailing cordials to keep my spirits on the\\r\\nwing. we lay at an inn that night, near the master\\'s house, and the next\\r\\nday i was initiated; and, at parting with me, my friend presented me\\r\\nwith a guinea. when i found myself thus rich, i must say i heartily\\r\\nwished they were all fairly at home again, that i might have time\\r\\nto count my cash, and dispose of such part of it as i had already\\r\\nappropriated to several uses then in embryo.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next morning left me master of my wishes, for my mother came and\\r\\ntook her last (though she little thought it) leave of me, and smothering\\r\\nme with her caresses and prayers for my well-doing, in the height of\\r\\nher ardour put into my hand another guinea, promising to see me again\\r\\nquickly; and desiring me, in the meantime, to be a very good husband,\\r\\nwhich i have since taken to be a sort of prophetic speech, she bid me\\r\\nfarewell.\\r\\n\\r\\ni shall not trouble you with the reception i met from my master, or his\\r\\nscholars, or tell you how soon i made friends of all my companions, by\\r\\nsome trifling largesses which my stock enabled me to bestow as occasion\\r\\nrequired; but i must inform you that, after sixteen years of idleness at\\r\\nhome, i had but little heart to my nouns and pronouns, which now\\r\\nbegan to be crammed upon me; and being the eldest lad in the house,\\r\\ni sometimes regretted the loss of the time past, and at other times\\r\\ndespaired of ever making a scholar at my years; and was ashamed to\\r\\nstand like a great lubber, declining of _haec mulier_ a woman, whilst\\r\\nmy schoolfellows, and juniors by five years, were engaged in the love\\r\\nstories of ovid, or the luscious songs of horace. i own these thoughts\\r\\nalmost overcame me, and threw me into a deep melancholy, of which i soon\\r\\nafter, by letter, informed my mother; who (by the advice, as i suppose,\\r\\nof my friend, by this time her suitor) sent me word to mind my studies,\\r\\nand i should want for nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter ii.\\r\\n\\r\\n     how he spent his time at the academy--an intrigue with a\\r\\n     servant-maid there--she declares herself with child by him--\\r\\n     her expostulations to him--he is put to it for money--\\r\\n     refused it from home by his friend, who had married his\\r\\n     mother--is drawn in to marry the maid--she lies-in at her\\r\\n     aunts--returns to her service--he has another child by her\\r\\n\\r\\ni had now been passing my time for about three months in this melancholy\\r\\nway, and, you may imagine, under that disadvantage, had made but little\\r\\nprogress in my learning, when one of our maids, taking notice one day\\r\\nof my uneasiness, as i sat musing in my chamber, according to my custom,\\r\\nbegan to rally me that i was certainly in love, i was so sad. indeed i\\r\\nnever had a thought of love before, but the good-natured girl seeming to\\r\\npity me, and seriously asking me the cause, i fairly opened my heart to\\r\\nher; and for fear my master should know it, gave her half-a-crown to be\\r\\nsilent. this last engagement fixed her my devotee, and from that time\\r\\nwe had frequent conferences in confidence together, till at length\\r\\ninclination, framed by opportunity, produced the date of a world of\\r\\nconcern to me; for about six months after my arrival at the academy,\\r\\ninstead of proving my parts by my scholarship, i had proved my manhood\\r\\nby being the destined father of an infant which my female correspondent\\r\\nthen assured me would soon be my own.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe nevertheless held on our frequent intercourse; nor was i so alarmed\\r\\nat the news as i ought to have been, till about two months after, when\\r\\npatty (for that was the only name i then knew her by) explained herself\\r\\nto me in the following terms:--\"you know, mr. peter, how matters are\\r\\nwith me: i should be very sorry, for your sake, and my own too, to\\r\\nreveal my shame, but in spite of us both nature will show itself; and\\r\\ntruly i think some care should be taken, and some method proposed, to\\r\\npreserve the infant, and avoid, as far as may be, the inconveniences\\r\\nthat may attend us, for here is now no room for delay.\" this speech, i\\r\\nown, gave me the first reflection i ever had in my life, and locked up\\r\\nall my faculties for a long time; nor was i able, for the variety of\\r\\nideas that crowded my brain, to make a word of answer, but stood like an\\r\\nimage of stone, till patty, seeing my confusion, desired me to recollect\\r\\nmy reason; for as it was too late to undo what had been done, it\\r\\nremained now only to act with that prudence and caution which the nature\\r\\nof the case required; and that, for her part, she would concur in every\\r\\nreasonable measure i should approve of; but i must remember she was only\\r\\na servant, and had very little due to her for wages, and not a penny\\r\\nbesides that; and that there must necessarily be a preparation made for\\r\\nthe reception of the infant when time should produce it. i now began to\\r\\nsee the absolute necessity of all she said, but how to accomplish it was\\r\\nnot in me to comprehend. my own small matter of money was gone, and had\\r\\nbeen so a long time; we therefore agreed i should write to my mother for\\r\\na fresh supply. i did so; and to my great confusion was answered by my\\r\\nformer friend in the following words:--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"son peter,--your mother and i are much surprised you should\\r\\n     write for money, having so amply provided for you; but as it\\r\\n     is not many months to christmas, when possibly we may send\\r\\n     for you home, you must make yourself easy till then; as a\\r\\n     school-boy, with all necessaries found him, cannot have much\\r\\n     occasion for money.--your loving father,\\r\\n     j. g.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nimagine, if it is possible, my consternation at the receipt of this\\r\\nletter. i began to think i should be tricked out of what my father and\\r\\ngrandfather had with so much pains and industry for many years been,\\r\\nheaping up for me, and had a thousand thoughts all together jostling out\\r\\neach other, so could resolve on nothing. i then showed patty the letter,\\r\\nand we both condoled my hard fortune, but saw no remedy. time wore away,\\r\\nand nothing done, or like to be, as i could see. for my part, i was like\\r\\none distracted, and no more able to assist or counsel what should be\\r\\ndone than a child in arms. at length poor patty, who had sat thinking\\r\\nsome time, began with telling me she had formed a scheme which in some\\r\\nmeasure might help us; but fearing it might be disagreeable to me, she\\r\\ndurst not mention it till i should assure her, whatever i thought of\\r\\nthat, i would think no worse of her for proposing it. this preparatory\\r\\nintroduction startled me a great deal; for it darted into my head she\\r\\nwaited for my concurrence to destroy the child, to which i could never\\r\\nhave consented. but upon my assuring her i would not think the worse of\\r\\nher for whatever she should propose, but freely give her my opinion upon\\r\\nit, she told me, as she could see no other way before us but what tended\\r\\nto our disgrace and ruin, if i would marry her she would immediately\\r\\nquit her place and return to her aunt, who had brought her up from a\\r\\nchild, and had enough prettily to live upon, who, she did not doubt,\\r\\nwould entertain her as my wife; but she was assured, upon any other\\r\\nscore, or under any other name, would prove her most inveterate\\r\\nenemy. when patty had made an end, i was glad to find it no worse; and\\r\\nrevolving matters a little in my mind, both as to affairs at home and\\r\\nthe requested marriage, i concluded upon this latter, and had a great\\r\\ninclination to acquaint my mother of it, but was diverted from that, by\\r\\nsuspecting it might prove a good handle for my new father to work with\\r\\nmy mother some mischief against me; so determined to marry forthwith,\\r\\nsend patty to her aunt\\'s, and remain still at the academy myself till\\r\\ni should see what turn things would take at home. accordingly, the next\\r\\nday good part of patty\\'s wages went to tie the connubial knot, and to\\r\\nthe honest parson for a bribe to antedate the certificate; and she very\\r\\nsoon after took up the rest to defray her journey to her aunt\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nthough patty was within two months of her time, she had so managed that\\r\\nno one perceived it; and getting safe to her aunt\\'s, was delivered of\\r\\na daughter, of which she wrote me word, and said she hoped to see me at\\r\\nthe end of her month. how, thought i, can she expect to see me; money i\\r\\nhave none! and then i despaired of leave for a journey if i had it;\\r\\nand to go without leave would only arm j. g. against me, as i perceived\\r\\nplainly his interest and mine were very remote things; so i resolved to\\r\\nquit all thoughts of a journey, and wait till opportunity better served\\r\\nfor seeing my wife and child, and our good aunt to whom we were so\\r\\nmuch obliged. while these and such-like cogitations engrossed my whole\\r\\nattention, i was most pleasingly surprised one day, upon my return-from\\r\\na musing walk by the river-side at the end of our garden, where i\\r\\nfrequently got my tasks, to find patty sitting in the kitchen with my\\r\\nold mistress, my master\\'s mother, who managed his house, he having been\\r\\na widower many years. the sight of her almost overcame me, as i had\\r\\nbolted into the kitchen, and was seen by my old mistress before i\\r\\nhad seen patty was with her. the old lady, perceiving me discomposed,\\r\\ninquired into the cause, which i directly imputed to the symptoms of an\\r\\nague that i told her i had felt upon me best part of the morning. she,\\r\\na good motherly woman, feeling my pulse, and satisfying herself of its\\r\\ndisorder, immediately ran to her closet to bring me a cordial, which she\\r\\nassured me had done wonders in the like cases; so that i had but just\\r\\ntime to embrace patty and inquire after our aunt and daughter before\\r\\nmadam returned with the cordial. having drank it, and given thanks, i\\r\\nwas going to withdraw, but she would not part with me so; for nothing\\r\\nless than my knowledge that this cordial was of her own making, from\\r\\nwhence she had the receipt, and an exact catalogue of the several cures\\r\\nit had done, would serve her turn; which, taking up full three-quarters\\r\\nof an hour, gave room to patty and me to enjoy each other\\'s glances for\\r\\nthat time, to our mutual satisfaction. at last the old prattlebox\\r\\nhaving made a short pause to recover breath from the narrative of the\\r\\ncordial, \"mr. peter,\" says she, \"you look as if you did not know poor\\r\\npatty; she has not left me so long that you should forget her; she is\\r\\na good tight wench, and i was sorry to part with her; but she is out of\\r\\nplace, she says, and as that dirty creature nan is gone, i think to take\\r\\nher again.\" i told her i well knew she was judge of a good servant, and\\r\\ni did not doubt patty was such, if she thought so; and then i made my\\r\\nexit, lighter in heart by a pound than i came.\\r\\n\\r\\ni shall not tire you any farther with the amours between self and patty;\\r\\nbut to let you know she quitted her place again seven months after, upon\\r\\nthe same score.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter iii.\\r\\n\\r\\n     minds his studies--informs his master of his mother\\'s\\r\\n     marriage, and usage of him--hears of her death--makes his\\r\\n     master his guardian--goes with him to take possession of his\\r\\n     estate--is informed all is given to his father-in-law--moral\\r\\n     reflections on his condition, and on his father\\'s crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\ni was now near nineteen years of age; and though i had so much more in\\r\\nmy head than my school-learning, i know not how it happened, but ever\\r\\nsince the commencement of my amour with patty, having somebody to\\r\\ndisburden my mind to, and to participate in my concerns, i had been\\r\\nmuch easier, and had kept true tally with my book, with more than usual\\r\\ndelight; and being arrived to an age to comprehend what i heard and\\r\\nread, i could, from the general idea i had of things, form a pretty\\r\\nregular piece of latin, without being able to repeat the very rules it\\r\\nwas done by; so that i had the acknowledgment of my master for the best\\r\\ncapacity he ever had under his tuition: this, he not sparing frequently\\r\\nto mention it before me, was the acutest spur he could have applied to\\r\\nmy industry; and now, having his good will, i began to disuse set hours\\r\\nof exercise, but at my conveniency applied myself to my studies as i\\r\\nbest pleased, being always sure to perform as much, or more, than he\\r\\never enjoined me; till i grew exceedingly in his confidence, and by\\r\\nreason of my age (though i was but small, yet manly) i became rather his\\r\\ncompanion upon parties than his direct pupil.\\r\\n\\r\\nit was upon one of these parties i took the opportunity to declare the\\r\\ndissatisfaction i had at my mother\\'s second marriage. \"sir,\" says i,\\r\\n\"surely i was of age to have known it first, especially considering the\\r\\naffection my mother had always shown to me, and my never once having\\r\\ndone the least thing to disoblige her; but, sir,\" said i, \"something\\r\\nelse, i fear, is intended by my mother\\'s silence to me; for i have never\\r\\nreceived above three letters from her since i came here, which is now,\\r\\nyou know, three years, and those were within the first three months.\\r\\ni then showed him the fore-mentioned letter i received from my new\\r\\nfather-in-law, and assured him that gave me the first hint of this\\r\\nsecond marriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\ni found, by the attention my master gave to my relation, he seemed to\\r\\nsuspect this marriage would prove detrimental to me; but not on the\\r\\nsudden knowing what to say to it, he told me he would consider of it;\\r\\nand, by all means, advised me to write a very obliging letter to my new\\r\\nfather, with my humble request that he would please to order me home the\\r\\nnext recess of our learning. i did so under my master\\'s dictation; and\\r\\nnot long after received an answer to the following effect:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"son peter,--your mother has been dead a good while; and as to your\\r\\nrequest, it will be only expensive, and of little use; for a person who\\r\\nmust live by his studies can\\'t apply to them too closely.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthis letter, if i had a little hope left, quite subdued my fortitude,\\r\\nand well-nigh reduced me to clay. however, with tears in my eyes, i\\r\\nshowed it to my master, who, good man! wishing me well, \"peter,\" says\\r\\nhe, \"what can this mean? here is some mystery concealed in it; here\\r\\nis some ill design on foot!\" then taking the letter into his hand, \"a\\r\\nperson who must live by his studies,\" says he; \"here is more meant than\\r\\nwe can think for. why, have not you a pretty estate to live upon, when\\r\\nit comes to your hands? peter,\" says he, \"i would advise you to go to\\r\\nyour father and inquire how your affairs are left; but i am afraid\\r\\nto let you go alone, and will, when my students depart at christmas,\\r\\naccompany you myself with all my heart; for you must know i have advised\\r\\non your affair already, and find you are of age to choose yourself a\\r\\nguardian, who may be any relation or friend you can confide in; and may\\r\\nsee you have justice done you.\" i immediately thanked him for the hint,\\r\\nand begged him to accept of the trust, as my only friend, having very\\r\\nfew, if any, near relations: this he with great readiness complied with,\\r\\nand was admitted accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nso soon as our scholars were gone home, my master lending me a horse,\\r\\nwe set out together to possess ourselves of all my father\\'s real estate,\\r\\nand such part of the personal as he had been advised would belong to\\r\\nme. well, we arrived at the old house, but were not received with such\\r\\nextraordinary tokens of friendship as would give the least room to\\r\\nsuppose we were welcome. for my part, all i said, or could say, was that\\r\\ni was very sorry for my mother\\'s death. my father replied so was he.\\r\\nhere we paused, and might have sat silent till this time for me, if my\\r\\nmaster, a grave man, who had seen the world, and was unwilling any part\\r\\nof our time there, which we guessed would be short, should be lost, had\\r\\nnot broke silence. \"mr. g.\" says he, \"i see the loss of master wilkins\\'s\\r\\nmother puts him under some confusion; so that you will excuse me, as his\\r\\npreceptor and friend, in making some inquiry how his affairs stand, and\\r\\nhow his effects are disposed, as i don\\'t doubt you have taken care to\\r\\nschedule everything that will be coming to him; and though he is not\\r\\nyet of the necessary age for taking upon himself the management of his\\r\\nestate, he is nevertheless of capacity to understand the nature and\\r\\nquantum of it, and to show his approbation of the disposition of it,\\r\\nas if he was a year or two older.\" during this discourse, mr. g. turned\\r\\npale, then reddened, was going to interrupt, then checked himself; but\\r\\nhowever kept silence till my master had done; when, with a sneer, he\\r\\nreplied, \"sir, i must own myself a great stranger to your discourse; nor\\r\\ncan i, for my life, imagine what your harangue tends to; but sure i am,\\r\\ni know of no estate, real or personal, or anything else belonging to\\r\\nyoung mr. wilkins, to make a schedule of, as you call it: but this i\\r\\nknow, his mother had an estate in land, near two hundred a year, and\\r\\nalso a good sum of money when i married her; but the estate she settled\\r\\non me before her marriage, to dispose of after her decease as i saw fit;\\r\\nand her money and goods are all come to my sole use, as her husband.\" i\\r\\nwas just ready to drop while mr. g. gave this relation, and was not able\\r\\nto reply a word; but my master, though sufficiently shocked at what he\\r\\nhad heard, replied, \"sir, i am informed the estate, and also the money\\r\\nyou mention, was mr. wilkins\\'s father\\'s at his death; and i am surprised\\r\\nto think any one should have a better title to them than my pupil, his\\r\\nonly child.\"--\"sir,\" says mr. g., \"you are deceived; and though what you\\r\\nsay seems plausible enough, and is in some part true, as that the late\\r\\nmr. wilkins had such estate, and some hundreds--i may say thousands--at\\r\\nhis death; yet you seem ignorant that he made a deed, just before\\r\\nentering into the fatal rebellion, by which he gave my late wife both\\r\\nthe estate, money, and everything else he had, absolutely, without any\\r\\nconditions whatsoever; all which, on his unhappy execution, she enjoyed,\\r\\nand now of right, as i told you before, belongs to me. however, as\\r\\ni have no child, if peter behaves well under your direction, i have\\r\\nthoughts of paying another year\\'s board for him, and then he must shift\\r\\nfor himself.\"--\"oh!\" cried i, \"for the mercy of some savage beast to\\r\\ndevour me! is this what i have been cockered up for? why was i not\\r\\nplaced out to some laborious craft, where i might have drudged for bread\\r\\nin my proper station? but i fear it is too late to inquire into what is\\r\\npast, and must submit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nmy master, good man! was thunderstruck at what he had heard; and finding\\r\\nour business done there, we took our leaves; after mr. g. had again\\r\\nrepeated, that if i behaved well, my preceptor should keep me another\\r\\nyear, which was all i must expect from him; and at my departure he gave\\r\\nme a crown-piece, which i then durst not refuse, for fear of offending\\r\\nmy master.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe made the best of our way home again to my tutor\\'s, where i stayed but\\r\\na week to consider what i should do for myself. in this time he did all\\r\\nhe could to comfort me; telling me if i would stay with him and become\\r\\nhis usher, he would complete my learning for nothing, and allow me a\\r\\nsalary for my trouble. but my heart was too lofty to think of becoming\\r\\nan usher within so little way from mine own estate in other hands.\\r\\nhowever, since i had not a penny of money to endeavour at recovering my\\r\\nright with, i told my master i would consider of his proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nduring my stay with him he used all methods to make me as easy as\\r\\npossible; and frequently moralised with so much effect, that i was\\r\\nalmost convinced i ought to submit and be content. amongst the rest\\r\\nof his discourse, he endeavoured to show me (one day after i had been\\r\\nloudly condemning my cruel fortune, and saying i was born to be unhappy)\\r\\nthat i was mistaken if i thought or imagined it was chance or accident\\r\\nthat had been against me when i complained of fortune. \"for,\" says he,\\r\\n\"peter, there is nothing done below but is at least foreknown, if not\\r\\ndecreed, above; and our business in life is to believe so: not that i\\r\\nwould have such belief make us careless, and think it to no purpose to\\r\\nstrive, as some do; who, being persuaded that our actions are not in our\\r\\nown choice, but that, being pressed by an irresistible decree, we\\r\\nare forced to act this or that, fancy we must be necessarily happy or\\r\\nmiserable hereafter; or, as others, who, for fear of falling upon that\\r\\nshocking principle, would even deprive the almighty of foreknowledge,\\r\\nlest it should consequentially amount to a decree: for, say they, what\\r\\nis foreknown, will and must be. but i would have you act so as that, let\\r\\neither of these tenets be true, you may still be sure of making yourself\\r\\neasy and happy; and for that purpose let me recommend to you a uniform\\r\\nlife of justice and piety; always choosing the good rather than the bad\\r\\nside of every action: for this, say they what they will to the contrary,\\r\\nis not above the power of a reasonable being to practise: and doing so,\\r\\nyou may without scruple say,--if there is foreknowledge of my actions,\\r\\nor they are decreed, i then am one who is foreknown or decreed to be\\r\\nhappy. and this, without farther speculation, you will find the only\\r\\nmeans always to keep you so; for all men, of all denominations, fully\\r\\nallow this happy effect to follow good actions. again, peter, a person\\r\\nacting in a vicious course, with such an opinion in his head as above,\\r\\nmust surely be very miserable, as his very actions themselves must\\r\\npronounce the decree against him: whilst, therefore, we have not heard\\r\\nthe decree read, you see we may easily give sentence whether it be for\\r\\ngood or evil to us, by the tenor and course of our own actions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"you are not now to learn, peter, that the crimes of the father are\\r\\noften punished in the children, often in the father himself, sometimes\\r\\nin both, and not seldom in neither, in this life; and though, at first,\\r\\none should think the future punishment annexed to bad actions was\\r\\nsufficient, still it is necessary some should suffer here also for an\\r\\nexample to others; we being much more affected with what the eye sees,\\r\\nthan what the heart only meditates upon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"now, to bring it to our own case; your father, peter, rose against the\\r\\nlawful magistrate, to deprive him (it matters not that he was a bad one)\\r\\nof his lawful power. your father\\'s policy was such, and his design so\\r\\nwell laid, as he thought, that upon any ill success to himself, he had\\r\\nsecured his estate to go in the way of all others he could wish to have\\r\\nit, and sits down very well contented that, happen what would, he should\\r\\nbite the government in preventing the forfeiture. but lo! his policy\\r\\nis as a wall of sand blown down with a puff! for it is to you it ought,\\r\\neven himself being umpire, to have come, as no one would think he would\\r\\nprize any before you, his own child. now, could he look from the grave,\\r\\nand know what passes here, and see mr. g. in possession of all he\\r\\nfancied he had secured for you, what a weak and short-sighted creature\\r\\nwould he find himself! if it be said he did not know he should have a\\r\\nchild, then herein appears god\\'s policy beyond man\\'s; for he knew it,\\r\\nand has so ordered that that child should be disinherited; for, by the\\r\\nway, peter, take this for a maxim, wherever the first principle of an\\r\\naction is ill, no good consequence can possibly ever be an attendant on\\r\\nit. could he, as i said before, but look up and see you, his only child,\\r\\nundone by the very instrument he designed for your security, how\\r\\npungent would be his anxiety! i say, peter, though there is something\\r\\nso unaccountable to human wisdom in such events of things, yet there is\\r\\nsomething therein so reasonable and just withal, that by a prying eye,\\r\\nthe supreme hand may very visibly be seen in them. now, this being\\r\\nplainly the case before us, and herein the glory of the almighty\\r\\nexalted, rest content under it, and let not this disappointment,\\r\\nbefallen you for your father\\'s faults, be attended with others sent down\\r\\nfor your own; but remember this, the hand that depresses a man is no\\r\\nless able to exalt and establish him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter iv.\\r\\n\\r\\n     departs secretly from his master--travels to bristol--\\r\\n     religious thoughts by the way--enters on shipboard, and is\\r\\n     made captain\\'s steward\\r\\n\\r\\ni seemed to be very well satisfied whilst my master was speaking; but\\r\\nthough i thought he talked like an angel, my former uneasiness seized me\\r\\nat parting with him. in short, without more consideration, i rose in\\r\\nthe morning early and marched off, having first wrote to my wife at her\\r\\naunt\\'s, relating the state of the case to her, with my resolution to\\r\\nleave england the first opportunity, giving her what comfort i could,\\r\\nassuring her if i ever was a gainer in life she should not fail to be a\\r\\npartaker, and promising also to let her know where i settled. i walked\\r\\nat a great rate, for fear my master\\'s kindness should prompt him to\\r\\nsend after me; and taking the bye-ways, i reached by dark night a\\r\\nlittle village, where i resolved to halt. upon inquiry i found myself\\r\\nthirty-five miles from my master\\'s. i had eaten nothing all day, and was\\r\\nvery hungry and weary, but my crown-piece was as yet whole; however i\\r\\nfed very sparingly, being over-pressed with the distress of my affairs\\r\\nand the confusion of my thoughts. i slept that night tolerably, but the\\r\\nmorning brought its face of horror with it. i had inquired over-night\\r\\nwhere i was, and been informed that i was not above sixteen miles from\\r\\nbristol, for which place i then resolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nat my setting out in the morning, after i had walked about three miles,\\r\\nand had recollected a little my master\\'s last discourse, i found by\\r\\ndegrees my spirit grew calmer than it had been since i left mr. g. at my\\r\\nhouse (as i shall ever call it), and looking into myself for the cause,\\r\\nfound another set of thoughts were preparing a passage into my mind,\\r\\nwhich did not carry half the dread and terror with them that their\\r\\npredecessors had; for i began to cast aside the difficulties and\\r\\napprehensions i before felt in my way, and encouraging the present\\r\\nmotions, soon became sensible of the benefit of a virtuous education;\\r\\nand though what i had hitherto done in the immediate service of god, i\\r\\nmust own had been performed from force, custom, and habit, and without\\r\\nthe least attention to the object of the duty; yet, as under my mother\\r\\nat home, and my master at the academy, i had been always used to say my\\r\\nprayers, as they called it, morning and night: i began, with a sort of\\r\\nsuperstitious reflection, to accuse myself of having omitted that duty\\r\\nthe night before, and also at my setting out in the morning, and very\\r\\nmuch to blame myself for it, and, at the same instant, even wondered at\\r\\nmyself for that blame. what, says i, is the real use of this praying;\\r\\nand to whom or to what do we pray? i see no one to pray to; neither have\\r\\ni ever thought that my prayers would be answered. it is true they are\\r\\nworded as if we prayed to god: but he is in heaven; does he concern\\r\\nhimself with us who can do him no service? can i think all my prayers\\r\\nthat i have said, from day to day, so many years, have been heard by\\r\\nhim? no, sure; if they had, i should scarce have sustained this hard\\r\\nfate in my fortune. but hold, how have i prayed to him? have i earnestly\\r\\nprayed to him, as i used to petition my mother for anything when i\\r\\nwanted it against her inclination? no, i can\\'t say i have. and would my\\r\\nmother have granted me such things, if she had not thought i had from my\\r\\nheart desired them, when i used to be so earnest with her? no, surely; i\\r\\ncan\\'t say she had any reason for it. but i had her indeed before me; now\\r\\ni have not god in my view: he is in heaven. yet, let me see; my master\\r\\n(and i can\\'t help thinking he must know) used to say that god is a\\r\\nspirit, and not confined by the incumbrance of a body, as we are; now,\\r\\nif it is so, why may he not virtually be present with me, though i don\\'t\\r\\nperceive him? why may he not be at once in heaven and elsewhere? for if\\r\\nhe consists not in parts, nothing can circumscribe him: and, truly,\\r\\ni believe it must be so; for if he is of that supreme power as he is\\r\\nrepresented, he could never act in so unconfined a capacity, under\\r\\nthe restraint of place; but if he is an operative and purely spiritual\\r\\nbeing, then i can see no reason why his virtual essence should not\\r\\nbe diffused through all nature; and then (which i begin to think most\\r\\nlikely) why should i not suppose him ever present with me, and able\\r\\nto hear me? and why should not i, when i pray, have a full idea of the\\r\\nbeing, though not of any corporeal parts or form of god, and so have\\r\\nactually somewhat to be intent upon in my prayers, and not do as i have\\r\\nhitherto done, say so many words only upon my knees; which i cannot help\\r\\nthinking may be as well without either sense or meaning in themselves,\\r\\nas without a proper object in my mind to direct them unto?\\r\\n\\r\\nthese thoughts agitated me at least two miles, working stronger and\\r\\nstronger in me; till at length, bursting into tears, have i been doing\\r\\nnothing, says i, in the sight of god, under the name of prayers, for so\\r\\nmany years? yes, it is certainly so. well, by the grace of god, it shall\\r\\nbe so no longer; i will try somewhat more. so looking round about me, to\\r\\nsee if i was quite alone, i stepped into an adjoining copse, and could\\r\\nscarce refrain falling on my knees, till i came to a proper place for\\r\\nkneeling in. i then poured forth my whole soul and spirit to god; and\\r\\nall my strength, and every member, every faculty was to the utmost\\r\\nemployed, for a considerable time, in the most agreeable as well as\\r\\nuseful duty. i would indeed have begun with my accustomed prayers, and\\r\\nhad repeated some words of them; when, as though against and contrary to\\r\\nmy design, i was carried away by such rapturous effusions that, to this\\r\\nhour, when i reflect thereon, i cannot believe but i was moved to them\\r\\nby a much more than human impulse. however, this ecstasy did not last\\r\\nabove a quarter of an hour; but it was considerably longer before my\\r\\nspirits subsided to their usual frame. when i had a little composed\\r\\nmyself, how was i altered! how did i condemn myself for all my past\\r\\ndisquiet! what calm thanks did i return for the ease and satisfaction\\r\\nof mind i then enjoyed! and coming to a small rivulet, i drank a hearty\\r\\ndraught of water and contentedly proceeded on my journey. i reached\\r\\nbristol about four o\\'clock in the afternoon. having refreshed myself,\\r\\ni went the same evening to the quay to inquire what ships were in the\\r\\nriver, whither bound, and when they would depart. my business was with\\r\\nthe sailors, of whom there were at that time great numbers there; but i\\r\\ncould meet with no employ, though i gave out i would gladly enter myself\\r\\nbefore the mast. after i had done the best i could, but without success,\\r\\ni returned to the little house i had dined at, and went to bed very\\r\\npensive. i did not forget my prayers; but i could by no means be roused\\r\\nto such devotion as i felt in the morning. next day i walked again\\r\\nto the quay, asking all i met, who looked like seafaring men, for\\r\\nemployment; but could hear of none, there being many waiting for berths;\\r\\nand i feared my appearance (which was not so mean as most of that sort\\r\\nof gentry is) would prove no small disappointment to my preferment that\\r\\nway. at last, being out of heart with my frequent repulses, i went to a\\r\\nlanding-place just by, and as i asked some sailors, who were putting two\\r\\ngentlemen on shore, if they wanted a hand on board their ship, one of\\r\\nthe gentlemen, whom i afterwards found to be the master of a vessel\\r\\nbound to the coast of africa, turned back and looking earnestly on me,\\r\\n\"young man,\" says he, \"do you want employment on board?\" i immediately\\r\\nmade him a bow, and answered, \"yes, sir.\" said he, \"there is no talking\\r\\nin this weather (for it then blew almost a storm), but step into that\\r\\ntavern,\" pointing to the place, \"and i will be with you presently.\" i\\r\\nwent thither, and not long after came my future master. he asked me many\\r\\nquestions, but the first was, whether i had been at sea. i told him no;\\r\\nbut i did not doubt soon to learn the duty of a sailor. he then looked\\r\\non my hand, and shaking his head, told me it would not do, for i had too\\r\\nsoft a hand. i told him i was determined for the sea, and that my hand\\r\\nand heart should go together; and i hoped my hand would soon harden,\\r\\nthough not my heart. he then told me it was a pity to take such a pretty\\r\\nyoung fellow before the mast; but if i understood accounts tolerably,\\r\\nand could write a good hand, he would make me his steward, and make it\\r\\nworth my while. i answered in the affirmative, joyfully accepting his\\r\\noffer; but on his asking me where my chest was (for, says he, if the\\r\\nwind had not been so strong against me, i had fallen down the river\\r\\nthis morning), i looked very blank, and plainly told him i had no other\\r\\nstores than i carried on my back. the captain smiled. says he, \"young\\r\\nman, i see you are a novice; why, the meanest sailor in my ship has a\\r\\nchest, at least, and perhaps something in it. come,\" says he, \"my lad,\\r\\ni like your looks; be diligent and honest; i will let you have a little\\r\\nmoney to set you out, and deduct it in your pay.\" he was then pulling\\r\\nout his purse, when i begged him, as he seemed to show me so great a\\r\\nkindness, that he would order somebody to buy what necessaries he knew\\r\\ni should want for me, or i should be under as great a difficulty to know\\r\\nwhat to get, and where to buy them, as i should have been at for want of\\r\\nthem. he commended my prudence, and said he would buy them and send them\\r\\non board himself; so bid me trouble myself no more about them, but go to\\r\\nthe ship in the return of his boat, and stay there till he came; giving\\r\\nme a ticket to the boat\\'s crew to take me in. when i came to the shore,\\r\\nthe boat was gone off and at a good distance; but i hailed them, and\\r\\nshowing my ticket, they put back and took me safe to the ship; heartily\\r\\nglad that i was entered upon my new service.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter v.\\r\\n\\r\\n     his first entertainment on board--sets sail--his sickness--\\r\\n     engagement with a french privateer--is taken and laid in\\r\\n     irons--twenty-one prisoners turned adrift in a small boat\\r\\n     with only two days\\' provision\\r\\n\\r\\nbeing once on board and in pay, i thought i was a man for myself, and\\r\\nset about considering how to behave; and nobody knowing, as yet, upon\\r\\nwhat footing i came on board, they took me for a passenger, as my dress\\r\\ndid not at all bespeak me a sailor; so every one, as i sauntered about,\\r\\nhad something to say to me. by and by comes a pert young fellow up:\\r\\n\"sir,\" says he, \"your servant; what, i see our captain has picked up a\\r\\npassenger at last.\"--\"passenger?\" says i; \"you are pleased to be\\r\\nmerry, sir; i am no passenger.\"--\"why, pray,\" says he, \"what may you\\r\\nbe then?\"--\"sir,\" says i, \"the captain\\'s steward.\"--\"you impertinent\\r\\npuppy,\" says he, \"what an answer you give me; you the captain\\'s steward!\\r\\nno, sir, that place, i can assure you, is in better hands!\" and away he\\r\\nturned. i knew not what to think of it, but was terribly afraid i should\\r\\ndraw myself into some scrape. by and by others asked me, some one thing,\\r\\nsome another, and i was very cautious what answers i made them, for fear\\r\\nof offence: till a gravish sailor came and sat down by me; and after\\r\\ntalking of the weather and other indifferent matters, \"pray,\" says i,\\r\\n\"sir, who is that gentleman that was so affronted at me soon after i\\r\\ncame on board?\"--\"oh,\" says he, \"a proud, insignificant fellow, the\\r\\ncaptain\\'s steward; but don\\'t mind him,\" says he; \"he uses the captain\\r\\nhimself as bad; they have had high words just before the captain went on\\r\\nshore; and had he used me as he did him, i should have made no ceremony\\r\\nof tipping him overboard--a rascal!\" says i, \"you surprise me; for the\\r\\ncaptain sent me on board to be his steward, and agreed with me about it\\r\\nthis afternoon.\"--\"hush,\" says he, \"i see how it will go; the captain,\\r\\nif that\\'s the case, will discharge him when he comes on board; and\\r\\nindeed i believe he would not have kept him so long, but we have waited\\r\\nfor a wind, and he could not provide himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe captain came on board at night; and the first thing he did was to\\r\\ndemand the keys of mr. steward, which he gave to me, and ordered him on\\r\\nshore.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next morning the captain went on shore himself; but the wind\\r\\nchopping about and standing fair about noon, he returned then with my\\r\\nchest, and before night we were got into sailing order, and before the\\r\\nwind with a brisk gale.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat happened the first fourteen days of our passage i know not, having\\r\\nbeen all that time so sick and weak i could scarcely keep life and soul\\r\\ntogether; but after grew better and better. we prosecuted our voyage,\\r\\ntouching for about a week at the madeiras in our way. the captain grew\\r\\nvery fond of me, and never put me to hard duty, and i passed my time,\\r\\nunder his favour, very pleasantly. one evening, being within sixty\\r\\nleagues of the cape of palms, calm weather, but the little wind we had\\r\\nagainst us, one of our men spied a sail, and gave the captain notice of\\r\\nit he, not suspecting danger, minded it little, and we made what way the\\r\\nwind would permit, but night coming on, and the calm continuing, about\\r\\npeep of day we perceived we were infallibly fallen in with a french\\r\\nprivateer, who, hoisting french colours, called out to us to strike. our\\r\\ncaptain had scarce time to consider what to do, they were so near us;\\r\\nbut as he had twenty-two men on board, and eight guns he could bring\\r\\nto, he called all hands upon deck, and telling them the consequence of a\\r\\nsurrender, asked them if they would stand by him. one and all swore\\r\\nthey would fight the ship to the bottom, rather than fall into the\\r\\nprivateer\\'s hands. the captain immediately gave the word for a clear\\r\\ndeck, prepared his firearms, and begged them to be active and obey\\r\\norders; and perceiving the privateer out-numbered our hands by\\r\\nabundance, he commanded all the small arms to be brought upon deck\\r\\nloaded, and to run out as many of the ship\\'s guns as she could bring to\\r\\non one side, and to charge them all with small shot, then stand to till\\r\\nhe gave directions. the privateer being a light ship, and a small breeze\\r\\narising, run up close to us, first firing one gun, then another, still\\r\\ncalling out to us to strike, but we neither returned fire nor answer,\\r\\ntill he came almost within pistol-shot of us, and seeing us a small\\r\\nvessel, thought to board us directly; but then our captain ordered a\\r\\nbroadside, and immediately all hands to come on deck; himself standing\\r\\nthere at the time of our first fire with his fusee in his hand, and\\r\\nnear him i stood with another. we killed eight men and wounded several\\r\\nothers. the privateer then fired a broadside through and through us.\\r\\nby this time our hands were all on deck, and the privateer pushing, in\\r\\nhopes to grapple and board us, we gave them a volley from thence, that\\r\\ndid good execution; and then all hands to the ship\\'s guns again, except\\r\\nfour, who were left along with me to charge the small arms. it is\\r\\nincredible how soon they had fired the great guns and were on deck\\r\\nagain. this last fire, being with ball, raked the privateer miserably.\\r\\nthen we fired the small arms, and away to the ship\\'s guns. this we did\\r\\nthree times successively without loss of a man, and i believe if\\r\\nwe could have held it once more, and no assistance had come to the\\r\\nprivateer, she had sheered quite off: but our captain spying a sail\\r\\nat some distance behind the privateer, who lay to windward of us, and\\r\\nseeing by his glass it was a frenchman, was almost dismayed; the same\\r\\nsight put courage into our enemies, who thereupon redoubled the attack,\\r\\nand the first volley of their small arms shot our captain in the breast,\\r\\nupon which he dropped dead without stirring. i need not say that sight\\r\\nshocked me exceedingly. indeed it disconcerted the whole action; and\\r\\nthough our mate, a man of good courage and experience, did all that a\\r\\nbrave man could do to animate the men, they apparently drooped, and\\r\\nthe loss of the ship became inevitable; so we struck, and the frenchman\\r\\nboarded us.\\r\\n\\r\\nduring the latter part of the engagement we had two men killed and five\\r\\nwounded, who died afterwards of their wounds. we, who were alive, were\\r\\nall ordered on board the frenchman, who, after rifling us, chained us\\r\\ntwo and two and turned us into the hold. our vessel was then ransacked;\\r\\nand the other privateer, who had suffered much the day before in an\\r\\nengagement with an english twenty-gun ship of war, coming up, the prize\\r\\nwas sent by her into port, where she herself was to refit. in this\\r\\ncondition did i and fourteen of our crew lie for six weeks, till the\\r\\nfetters on our legs had almost eaten to the bone, and the stench of the\\r\\nplace had well-nigh suffocated us.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe \"glorieux\" (for that was the name of the privateer who took us)\\r\\nsaw nothing farther in five weeks worth her notice, which very much\\r\\ndiscouraged the men; and consulting together, it was agreed to cruise\\r\\nmore northward, between sierra leone and cape de verde; but about noon\\r\\nnext day they spied a sail coming west-north-west with a fresh gale.\\r\\nthe captain thereupon ordered all to be ready, and lie by for her. but\\r\\nthough she discerned us, she kept her way, bearing only more southward;\\r\\nwhen the wind shifting to northeast, she ran for it, full before the\\r\\nwind, and we after her, with all the sail we could crowd; and though\\r\\nshe was a very good sailer, we gained upon her, being laden, and before\\r\\nnight came pretty well up with her; but being a large ship, and the\\r\\nevening hazy, we did not choose to engage her till morning. the next\\r\\nmorning we found she was slunk away; but we fetched her up, and hoisting\\r\\nfrench colours, fired a shot, which she not answering, our captain run\\r\\nalongside of her and fired a broadside; then slackening upon her, a\\r\\nhard engagement ensued; the shot thumping so against our ship, that we\\r\\nprisoners, who had nothing to do in the action, expected death, one or\\r\\nother of us, every moment. the merchantman was so heavy loaded, and drew\\r\\nso much water, that she was very unwieldy in action; so after a fight of\\r\\ntwo hours, when most of her rigging and masts were cut and wounded, she\\r\\nstruck. twelve men were sent on board her, and her captain and several\\r\\nofficers were ordered on board us.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere were thirty-eight persons in her, including passengers; all of\\r\\nwhom, except five, and the like number which had been killed in the\\r\\naction, were sent chained into the hold to us, who had lain there almost\\r\\nsix weeks. this prize put monsieur into good heart, and determined him\\r\\nto return home with her. but in two days\\' time his new acquisition was\\r\\nfound to have leaked so fast near the bottom, that before they were\\r\\naware of it the water was risen some feet. several hands were employed\\r\\nto find out the leak; but all asserted it was too low to be come at; and\\r\\nas the pumps, with all the labour the prisoners, who were the persons\\r\\nput to it, could use, would not reduce it, but it still increased, they\\r\\nremoved what goods they could into the privateer; and before they could\\r\\nunload it the prize sunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next thing they consulted upon was what to do with the prisoners,\\r\\nwho, by the loss of the prize, were now grown too numerous to be trusted\\r\\nin the privateer; fearing, too, as they were now so far out at sea,\\r\\nby the great addition of mouths, they might soon be brought to short.\\r\\nallowance, it was, on both accounts, resolved to give us the prize\\'s\\r\\nboat, which they had saved, and turn us adrift to shift for ourselves.\\r\\nthere were in all forty-three of us; but the privateer having lost\\r\\nseveral of their own men in the two engagements, they looked us over,\\r\\nand picking out two-and-twenty of us, who were the most likely fellows\\r\\nfor their purpose, the remaining one-and-twenty were committed to the\\r\\nboat, with about two days\\' provision and a small matter of ammunition,\\r\\nand turned out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter vi.\\r\\n\\r\\n     the boat, two hundred leagues from land, makes no way, but\\r\\n     drives more to sea by the wind--the people live nine days at\\r\\n     quarter allowance--four die with hunger the twelfth day--\\r\\n     five more the fourteenth day--on the fifteenth they eat one\\r\\n     just dead--want of water excessive--spy a sail--are taken up\\r\\n     --work their passage to the african shore--are sent on a\\r\\n     secret expedition--are waylaid, taken slaves, and sent up\\r\\n     the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we, who were in the boat, came to reflect on our condition, the\\r\\nprospect before us appeared very melancholy; though we had at first\\r\\nreadily enough embraced the offer, rather than perish in so much misery\\r\\nas we suffered in our loathsome confinement. we now judged we were above\\r\\ntwo hundred leagues from land, in about eight degrees north latitude;\\r\\nand it blowing north-east, a pretty stiff gale, we could make no way,\\r\\nbut rather lost, for we aimed at some port in africa, having neither\\r\\nsail, compass, nor any other instrument to direct us; so that all the\\r\\nobservation we could make was by the sun for running southward, or as\\r\\nthe wind carried us, for we had lost the north pole. as we had little\\r\\nabove two days\\' provisions, we perceived a necessity of almost starving\\r\\nvoluntarily, to avoid doing it quite, seeing it must be many days before\\r\\nwe could reach shore, if ever we did, having visibly driven a great deal\\r\\nmore southward than we were; nay, unless a sudden change happened, we\\r\\nwere sure of perishing, unless delivered by some ship that providence\\r\\nmight send in our way. in short, the ninth day came, but no relief with\\r\\nit; and though we had lived at quarter allowance, and but just saved\\r\\nlife, our food, except a little water, was all gone, and this caused\\r\\nus quite to despair. on the twelfth day four of our company died with\\r\\nhunger in a very miserable way; and yet the survivors had not strength\\r\\nleft to move them to pity their fellows. in truth, we had sat still,\\r\\nattempting nothing in several days; as we found that, unless the wind\\r\\nshifted, we only consumed the little strength we had left to no manner\\r\\nof purpose. on the fourteenth day, and in the night, five more died, and\\r\\na sixth was near expiring; and yet we, the survivors, were so indolent,\\r\\nwe would scarce lend a hand to throw them overboard. on the fifteenth\\r\\nday, in the morning, our carpenter, weak as he was, started up, and as\\r\\nthe sixth man was just dead, cut his throat, and whilst warm let out\\r\\nwhat blood would flow; then pulling off his old jacket, invited us to\\r\\ndinner, and cutting a large slice of the corpse, devoured it with as\\r\\nmuch seeming relish as if it had been ox-beef. his example prevailed\\r\\nwith the rest of us, one after another, to taste and eat; and as\\r\\nthere had been a heavy dew or rain in the night, and we had spread out\\r\\neverything we had of linen and woollen to receive it, we were a little\\r\\nrefreshed by wringing our clothes and sipping what came from them; after\\r\\nwhich we covered them up from the sun, stowing them all close together\\r\\nto keep in the moisture, which served us to suck at for two days after,\\r\\na little and a little at a time; for now we were in greater distress for\\r\\nwater than for meat. it has surprised me, many times since, to think how\\r\\nwe could make so light a thing of eating our fellow creature just dead\\r\\nbefore our eyes; but i will assure you, when we had once tasted, we\\r\\nlooked on the blessing to be so great, that we cut and eat with as\\r\\nlittle remorse as we should have had for feeding on the best meat in\\r\\nan english market; and most certainly, when this corpse had failed,\\r\\nif another had not dropped by fair means, we should have used foul by\\r\\nmurdering one of our number as a supply for the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nwater, as i said before, to moisten our mouths, was now our greatest\\r\\nhardship, for every man had so often drank his own, that we voided\\r\\nscarce anything but blood, and that but a few drops at a time; our\\r\\nmouths and tongues were quite flayed with drought, and our teeth just\\r\\nfallen from our jaws; for though we had tried, by placing all the\\r\\ndead men\\'s jackets and shirts one over another, to strain some of the\\r\\nsea-water through them by small quantities, yet that would not deprive\\r\\nit of its pernicious qualities; and though it refreshed a little in\\r\\ngoing down, we were so sick, and strained ourselves so much after it,\\r\\nthat it came up again, and made us more miserable than before. our\\r\\ncorpse now stunk so, what was left of it, that we could no longer bear\\r\\nit on board, and every man began to look with an evil eye on his fellow,\\r\\nto think whose turn it would be next; for the carpenter had started the\\r\\nquestion, and preached us into the necessity of it; and we had agreed,\\r\\nthe next morning, to put it to the lot who should be the sacrifice. in\\r\\nthis distress of thought it was so ordered by good providence, that\\r\\non the twenty-first day we thought we spied a sail coming from the\\r\\nnorth-west, which caused us to delay our lots till we should see whether\\r\\nit would discover us or not: we hung up some jackets upon our oars, to\\r\\nbe seen as far off as we could, but had so little strength left we could\\r\\nmake no way towards it; however, it happened to direct its course so\\r\\nmuch to our relief, that an hour before sunset it was within a league\\r\\nof us, but seemed to bear away more eastward, and our fear was that they\\r\\nshould not know our distress, for we were not able to make any noise\\r\\nfrom our throats that might be heard fifty yards; but the carpenter, who\\r\\nwas still the best man amongst us, with much ado getting one of the guns\\r\\nto go off, in less than half-an-hour she came up with us, and seeing\\r\\nour deplorable condition, took us all on board, to the number of eleven.\\r\\nthough no methods were un-essayed for our recovery, four more of us\\r\\ndied in as many days. when the remaining seven of us came a little to\\r\\nourselves, we found our deliverers were portuguese, bound for saint\\r\\nsalvadore. we told the captain we begged he would let us work our\\r\\npassage with him, be it where it would, to shore; and then, if we could\\r\\nbe of no further service to him, we did not doubt getting into europe\\r\\nagain: but in the voyage, as we did him all the service in our power, we\\r\\npleased him so well that he engaged us to stay with him to work the ship\\r\\nhome again, he having lost some hands by fever soon after his setting\\r\\nsail.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe arrived safe in port; and in a few days the captain, who had a secret\\r\\nenterprise to take in hand, hired a country coasting vessel, and sent\\r\\nher seventeen leagues farther on the coast for orders from some factory\\r\\nor settlement there. i was one of the nine men who were destined to\\r\\nconduct her; but not understanding portuguese, i knew little of the\\r\\nbusiness we went upon. we were to coast it all the way; but on the tenth\\r\\nday, just at sunrise, we fell in with a fleet of boats which had waylaid\\r\\nus, and were taken prisoners. being carried ashore, we were conducted a\\r\\nlong way up the country, where we were imprisoned, and almost starved,\\r\\nthough i never knew the meaning of it; nor did any of us, unless the\\r\\nmate, who, we heard, was carried up the country much farther, to angola;\\r\\nbut we never heard more of him, though we were told he would be sent\\r\\nback to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nhere we remained under confinement almost three months, at the end of\\r\\nwhich time our keeper told us we were to be removed; and coupling us two\\r\\nand two together, sent a guard with us to angola; when, crossing a\\r\\nlarge river, we were set to work in removing the rubbish and stones of\\r\\na castle or fortress, which had been lately demolished by an earthquake\\r\\nand lightning. here we continued about five months, being very sparingly\\r\\ndieted, and locked up every night.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis place, however, i thought a paradise to our former dungeon; and as\\r\\nwe were not overworked, we made our lives comfortable enough, having the\\r\\nair all day to refresh us from the heat, and not wanting for company;\\r\\nfor there were at least three hundred of us about the whole work; and\\r\\ni often fancied myself at the tower of babel, each labourer almost\\r\\nspeaking in a language of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\ntowards the latter end of our work our keepers grew more and more remiss\\r\\nin their care of us. at my first coming thither, i had contracted a\\r\\nfamiliarity with one of the natives, but of a different kingdom, who was\\r\\nthen a slave with me; and he and i being able tolerably to understand\\r\\neach other, he hinted to me, one day, the desire he had of seeing his\\r\\nown country and family, who neither knew whether he was dead or alive,\\r\\nor where he was, since he had left them, seven years before, to make war\\r\\nin this kingdom; and insinuated that as he had taken a great liking to\\r\\nme, if i would endeavour to escape with him, and we succeeded, he would\\r\\nprovide for me. \"for,\" says he, \"you see, now our work is almost over,\\r\\nwe are but slightly guarded; and if we stay till this job is once\\r\\nfinished, we may be commanded to some new works at the other end of the\\r\\nkingdom, for aught we know, so that our labours will only cease with our\\r\\nlives: and for my part, immediate death in the attempt of liberty is to\\r\\nme preferable to a lingering life of slavery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthese, and such-like arguments, prevailed on me to accompany him, as he\\r\\nhad told me he had travelled most of the country before in the wars of\\r\\nthe different nations; so having taken our resolution, the following\\r\\nevening, soon after our day\\'s work, and before the time came for locking\\r\\nup, we withdrew from the rest, but within hearing, thinking if we should\\r\\nthen be missed and called, we would appear and make some excuse for our\\r\\nabsence, but if not, we should have the whole night before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we were first put upon this work, we were called over singly, by\\r\\nname, morning and evening, to be let out and in, and were very narrowly\\r\\nobserved in our motions; but not one of us having been ever absent, our\\r\\nactions were at length much less minded than before, and the ceremony of\\r\\ncalling us over was frequently omitted; so that we concluded if we\\r\\ngot away unobserved the first night, we should be out of the reach of\\r\\npursuers by the next; which was the soonest it was possible for them to\\r\\novertake us, as we proposed to travel the first part of our journey with\\r\\nthe utmost despatch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter vii.\\r\\n\\r\\n     the author escapes with glanlepze a native--their hardships\\r\\n     in travel--plunder of a cottage--his fears--adventure with a\\r\\n     crocodile--passage of a river--adventure with a lioness and\\r\\n     whelps--arrive at glanlepzis house--the trial of glanlepze\\'s\\r\\n     wife\\'s constancy--the tender meeting of her and her\\r\\n     husband--the author\\'s reflections thereupon.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving now set out with all possible speed, we seemed to each other as\\r\\njoyful as we could; though it cannot be supposed we had no fears in our\\r\\nminds the first part of our journey, for we had many; but as our way\\r\\nadvanced our fears subsided; and having, with scarce any delay, pushed\\r\\nforwards for the first twenty-four hours, nature then began to have two\\r\\nvery pressing demands upon us, food and rest; but as one of them was\\r\\nabsolutely out of our power to comply with, she contented herself\\r\\nwith the other till we should be better able to supply her, and gave a\\r\\nfarther time till the next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next morning found us very empty and sharp-set, though a very sound\\r\\nnight\\'s rest had contributed its utmost to refresh us. but what added\\r\\nmuch to our discomfort was, that though our whole subsistence must come\\r\\nfrom fruits, there was not a tree to be found at a less distance than\\r\\ntwelve leagues, in the open rocky country we were then in; but a good\\r\\ndraught of excellent water we met with did us extraordinary service, and\\r\\nsent us with much better courage to the woods, though they were quite\\r\\nout of the way of our route: there, by divers kinds of fruits, which,\\r\\nthough my companion knew very well, i was quite a stranger to, we\\r\\nsatisfied our hunger for the present, and took a moderate supply for\\r\\nanother opportunity. this retarded our journey very much, for in so hard\\r\\ntravel every pound weighed six before night.\\r\\n\\r\\ni cannot say this journey, though bad enough, would have been so\\r\\ndiscouraging, but for the trouble of fetching our provisions so far; and\\r\\nthen, if we meant not to lose half the next day in the same manner, we\\r\\nmust double load ourselves, and delay our progress by that means; but we\\r\\nstill went on, and in about eight days got quite clear of angola.\\r\\n\\r\\non the eighth day, my companion, whose name was glanlepze, told me we\\r\\nwere very near the confines of congo, but there was one little village\\r\\nstill in angola by which we must pass within half a league; and if i\\r\\nwould agree to it, he would go see what might be got here to supply\\r\\nourselves with. i told him i was in an unknown world, and would follow\\r\\nwherever he should lead me; but asked him if he was not afraid of the\\r\\npeople, as he was not of that country. he told me as there had been wars\\r\\nbetween them and his country for assisting their neighbours of congo,\\r\\nhe was not concerned for any mischief he should do them, or they him.\\r\\n\"but,\" says he, \"you have a knife in your pocket, and with that we will\\r\\ncut two stout clubs, and then follow me and fear nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwe soon cut our clubs, and marching on, in the midst of some small\\r\\nshrubs and a few scattering trees, we saw a little hovel, larger indeed,\\r\\nbut worse contrived, than an english hog-stye, to which we boldly\\r\\nadvanced; and glanlepze entering first, saluted an old man who was lying\\r\\non a parcel of rushes. the man attempted to run away, but glanlepze\\r\\nstopped him, and we tied his hands and feet he then set up such a\\r\\nhideous howl, that had not glanlepze threatened to murder him, and\\r\\nprepared to do it, he would have raised the whole village upon us;\\r\\nbut we quieted him, and rummaging to find provision, which was all we\\r\\nwanted, we by good luck spied best part of a goat hanging up behind a\\r\\nlarge mat at the farther end of the room. by this time in comes a woman\\r\\nwith two children, very small. this was the old man\\'s daughter, of about\\r\\nfive-and-twenty. glanlepze bound her also, and laid her by the old man;\\r\\nbut the two children we suffered to lie untied. we then examined her,\\r\\nwho told us the old man was her father, and that her husband, having\\r\\nkilled a goat that morning, was gone to carry part of it to his sister;\\r\\nthat they had little or no corn; and finding we wanted victuals, she\\r\\ntold us there was an earthen pot we might boil some of the goat in if we\\r\\npleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving now seen all that was to be had, we were going to make up our\\r\\nbundle, when a muletto very gently put his head into the doorway: him\\r\\nglanlepze immediately seized; and bidding me fetch the great mat and the\\r\\ngoat\\'s flesh, he in the meantime put a long rope he found there about\\r\\nthe beast\\'s neck, and laying the mat upon him, we packed up the goat\\'s\\r\\nflesh and a little corn in a calabash-shell; and then turning up the mat\\r\\nround about, skewered it together, and over all we tied the earthen pot;\\r\\nglanlepze crying out at everything we loaded, \"it is no hurt to plunder\\r\\nan enemy!\" and so we marched off.\\r\\n\\r\\ni own i had greater apprehensions from this adventure than from anything\\r\\nbefore. \"for,\" says i, \"if the woman\\'s husband returns soon, or if she\\r\\nor her father can release themselves, they will raise the whole village\\r\\nupon us, and we are undone.\" but glanlepze laughed at me, saying we had\\r\\nnot an hour\\'s walk out of the angola dominions, and that the king of\\r\\ncongo was at war with them in helping the king of loango, whose subject\\r\\nhimself was; and that the angolans durst not be seen out of their\\r\\nbounds on that side the kingdom; for there was a much larger village\\r\\nof congovians in our way, who would certainly rise and destroy them, if\\r\\nthey came in any numbers amongst them; and though the war being carried\\r\\non near the sea, the borders were quiet, yet, upon the least stir, the\\r\\nwhole country would be in arms, whilst we might retire through the woods\\r\\nvery safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nwell, we marched on as fast as we could all the remainder of that day\\r\\ntill moonlight, close by the skirt of a long wood, that we might take\\r\\nshelter therein, if there should be occasion $ and my eyes were the best\\r\\npart of the way behind me; but neither hearing nor seeing anything to\\r\\nannoy us, and finding by the declivity of the ground we should soon\\r\\nbe in some plain or bottom, and have a chance of water for us all, and\\r\\npasture for our muletto, which was now become one of us, we would not\\r\\nhalt till we found a bottom to the hill, which in half an hour more we\\r\\ncame to, and in some minutes after to a rivulet of fine clear water,\\r\\nwhere we resolved to spend the night. here we fastened our muletto\\r\\nby his cord to a stake in the ground; but perceiving him not to\\r\\nhave sufficient range to fill his belly in before morning, we, under\\r\\nglanlepze\\'s direction, cut several long slips from the mat, and soaking\\r\\nthem well in water, twisted them into a very strong cord, of sufficient\\r\\nlength for the purpose. and now, having each of us brought a bundle\\r\\nof dry fallen sticks from the wood with us, and gathered two or three\\r\\nflints as we came along, we struck fire on my knife upon some rotten\\r\\nwood, and boiled a good piece of our goat\\'s flesh; and having made such\\r\\na meal as we had neither of us made for many months before, we laid us\\r\\ndown and slept heartily till morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nas soon as day broke we packed up our goods, and filling our calabash\\r\\nwith water, we loaded our muletto, and got forward very pleasantly that\\r\\nday and several others following, and had tolerable lodgings.\\r\\n\\r\\nabout noon, one day, travelling with great glee, we met an adventure\\r\\nwhich very much daunted me, and had almost put a stop to my hopes of\\r\\never getting where i intended. we came to a great river whose name i\\r\\nhave now forgot, near a league over, but full, and especially about\\r\\nthe shores, of large trees that had fallen from the mountains and been\\r\\nrolled down with the floods, and lodged there in a shocking manner. this\\r\\nriver, glanlepze told me, we must pass: for my part, i shrunk at the\\r\\nsight of it, and told him if he could get over, i would not desire to\\r\\nprevent his meeting with his family; but as for my share, i had rather\\r\\ntake my chance in the woods on this side than plunge myself into such\\r\\na stream only for the sake of drowning. \"oh!\" says glanlepze, \"then you\\r\\ncan\\'t swim?\"--\"no,\" says i; \"there\\'s my misfortune.\"--\"well,\" says the\\r\\nkind glanlepze, \"be of good heart; i\\'ll have you over.\" he then bade me\\r\\ngo cut an armful of the tallest of the reeds that grew there near the\\r\\nshore, whilst he pulled up another where he then was, and bring them to\\r\\nhim. the side of the river sloped for a good way with an easy descent,\\r\\nso that it was very shallow where the reeds grew, and they stood very\\r\\nclose together upon a large compass of ground. i had no sooner entered\\r\\nthe reeds a few yards, to cut some of the longest, but (being about\\r\\nknee-deep in the water and mud, and every step raising my feet very high\\r\\nto keep them clear of the roots, which were matted together) i thought\\r\\ni had trod upon a trunk of one of the trees, of which, as i said, there\\r\\nwas such plenty thereabouts; and raising my other foot to get that also\\r\\nupon the tree, as i fancied it, i found it move along with me; upon\\r\\nwhich i roared out, when glanlepze, who was not far from me, imagining\\r\\nwhat was the matter, cried out, \"leap off, and run to shore to the\\r\\nright!\" i knew not yet what was the case, but did what i was bid, and\\r\\ngained the shore. looking back, i perceived the reeds shake and\\r\\nrustle all the way to the shore, by degrees after me. i was terribly\\r\\nfrightened, and ran to glanlepze, who then told me the danger i had\\r\\nescaped, and that what i took for a tree was certainly a large alligator\\r\\nor crocodile.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy blood ran chill within me at hearing the name of such a dangerous\\r\\ncreature; but he had no sooner told me what it was, than out came\\r\\nthe most hideous monster i had ever seen. glanlepze ran to secure the\\r\\nmuletto; and then taking the cord which had fastened him, and tying it\\r\\nto each end of a broken arm of a tree that lay on the shore, he marched\\r\\nup to the crocodile without the least dismay, and beginning near the\\r\\ntail, with one leg on one side, and the other on the other side, he\\r\\nstraddled over him, still mending his pace as the beast crept forward,\\r\\ntill he came to his fore-feet; then throwing the great log before his\\r\\nmouth, he, by the cord in his hand, bobbed it against the creature\\'s\\r\\nnose, till he gaped wide enough to have taken in the muletto; then of\\r\\na sudden, jerking the wood between his jaws with all his force by the\\r\\ncord, he gagged the beast, with his jaws wide open up to his throat, so\\r\\nthat he could neither make use of his teeth nor shut his mouth; he then\\r\\nthrew one, end of the cord upon the ground, just before the creature\\'s\\r\\nunder-jaw, which, as he by degrees crept along over it, came out behind\\r\\nhis fore-legs on the contrary side; and serving the other end of it in\\r\\nthe same manner, he took up those ends and tied them over the creature\\'s\\r\\nback, just within his forelegs, which kept the gag firm in his mouth;\\r\\nand then calling out to me (for i stood at a good distance), \"peter,\"\\r\\nsays he, \"bring me your knife!\" i trembled at going so near, for the\\r\\ncrocodile was turning his head this way and that very uneasy, and\\r\\nwanting to get to the river again, but yet i carried it, keeping as\\r\\nmuch behind him as i could, still eyeing him which way he moved, and at\\r\\nlength tossed my knife so near that glanlepze could reach it; and he,\\r\\njust keeping behind the beast\\'s forefeet, and leaning forward, first\\r\\ndarted the knife into one eye, and then into the other; and immediately\\r\\nleaping from his back, came running to me. \"so, peter,\" says he, \"i have\\r\\ndone the business.\"--\"aye! business enough, i think,\" says i, \"and more\\r\\nthan i would have done to have been king of congo.\"--\"why, peter,\" says\\r\\nhe, \"there is nothing but a man may compass by resolution, if he takes\\r\\nboth ends of a thing in his view at once, and fairly deliberates on both\\r\\nsides what may be given and taken from end to end. what you have seen\\r\\nme perform is only from a thorough notion i have of this beast and of\\r\\nmyself, how far each of us hath power to act and counteract upon the\\r\\nother, and duly applying the means. but,\", says he, \"this talk will not\\r\\ncarry us across the river; come, here are the reeds i have pulled up,\\r\\nwhich i believe will be sufficient without any more, for i would\\r\\nnot overload the muletto.\"--\"why,\" says i, \"is the muletto to carry\\r\\nthem?\"--\"no, they are to carry you,\" says he.--\"i can never ride upon\\r\\nthese,\" says i.--\"hush!\" says he, \"i\\'ll not lose you, never fear. come,\\r\\ncut me a good tough stick, the length of these reeds.\"--\"well,\" says i,\\r\\n\"this is all conjuration; but i don\\'t see a step towards my getting over\\r\\nthe river yet, unless i am to ride the muletto upon these reeds, and\\r\\nguide myself with the stick.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"i must own, peter,\" says he, \"you have a bright guess.\" so taking an\\r\\narmful of the reeds, and laying them on the ground, \"now, peter,\" says\\r\\nhe, \"lay that stick upon those reeds and tie them tight at both ends.\"\\r\\ni did so. \"now, peter,\" says he, \"lay yourself down upon them.\" i then\\r\\nlaying myself on my back, lengthwise, upon the reeds, glanlepze laughed\\r\\nheartily at me, and turning me about, brought my breast upon the reeds\\r\\nat the height of my arm-pits; and then taking a handful of the reeds he\\r\\nhad reserved by themselves, he laid them on my back, tying them to the\\r\\nbundle close at my shoulders, and again at the ends. \"now, peter,\" says\\r\\nhe, \"stand up;\" which i did, but it was full as much as i could do. i\\r\\nthen seeing glanlepze laughing at the figure i cut, desired him to be\\r\\nserious, and not put me upon losing my life for a joke; for i could not\\r\\nthink what he would do next with me. he bid me never fear; and looking\\r\\nmore soberly, ordered me to walk to the river, and so stand just within\\r\\nthe bank till he came; then leading the muletto to me, he tied me to\\r\\nher, about a yard from the tail, and taking the cord in his hand, led\\r\\nthe muletto and me into the water. we had not gone far before my guide\\r\\nbegan to swim, then the muletto and i were presently chin-deep, and i\\r\\nexpected nothing but drowning every moment: however, having gone so far,\\r\\ni was ashamed to cry out; when getting out of my depth, and my reeds\\r\\ncoming to their bearing, up i mounted, and was carried on with all\\r\\nthe ease imaginable; my conductor guiding us between the trees so\\r\\ndexterously, that not one accident happened to either of us all the way,\\r\\nand we arrived safe on the opposite shore.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had now got into a very low, close, swampy country, and our goat\\'s\\r\\nflesh began to be very stale through the heat, not only of the sun, but\\r\\nthe muletto\\'s back: however, we pleased ourselves we should have one\\r\\nmore meal of it before it was too bad to eat; so, having travelled about\\r\\nthree miles from the river, we took up our lodging on a little rising,\\r\\nand tied our muletto in a valley about half a furlong below us, where he\\r\\nmade as good a meal in his way as we did in ours.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had but just supped, and were sauntering about to find the easiest\\r\\nspot to sleep on, when we heard a rustling and a grumbling noise in a\\r\\nsmall thicket just on our right, which seeming to approach nearer and\\r\\nnearer, glanlepze roused himself, and was on his legs just time enough\\r\\nto see a lioness and a small whelp which accompanied her, within thirty\\r\\nyards of us, making towards us, as we afterwards guessed, for the sake\\r\\nof our goat\\'s flesh, which now smelt very strong. glanlepze whipped on\\r\\nthe contrary side of the fire to that where the goat\\'s flesh lay, and\\r\\nfell to kicking the fire about at a great rate, which being made of dry\\r\\nwood, caused innumerable sparks to fly about us; but the beasts still\\r\\napproaching in a couchant manner, and seizing the ribs of the goat\\r\\nand other bones (for we had only cut the flesh off), and grumbling and\\r\\ncracking them like rotten twigs, glanlepze snatched up a fire-brand,\\r\\nflaming, in each hand, and made towards them; which sight so terrified\\r\\nthe creatures that they fled with great precipitation to the thicket\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nglanlepze was a little uneasy at the thoughts of quitting so good a\\r\\nlodging as we had found, but yet held it best to move farther; for as\\r\\nthe lions had left the bones behind them, we must expect another visit\\r\\nif we stayed there, and could hope for no rest; and, above all, we might\\r\\npossibly lose our muletto; so we removed our quarters two miles farther,\\r\\nwhere we slept with great tranquillity.\\r\\n\\r\\nreflections on the nature of mankind have often astonished me. i told\\r\\nyou at first my thoughts concerning prayer in my journey to bristol, and\\r\\nof the benefit i received from it, and how fully i was convinced of\\r\\nthe necessity of it; which one would think was a sufficient motive to a\\r\\nreasonable creature to be constant in it; and yet, it is too true that,\\r\\nnotwithstanding the difficulties i had laboured under, and hardships i\\r\\nhad undergone, and the danger of starving at sea or being murdered for\\r\\nfood by my fellows, when there was as urgent a necessity of begging\\r\\ndivine assistance as can be conceived, i never once thought of it, nor\\r\\nof the object of it, nor returned thanks for my being delivered, till\\r\\nthe lioness had just left me; and then i felt near the same force urging\\r\\nme to return thanks for my escape, as i had impelling me to prayer\\r\\nbefore; and i think i did so with great sincerity.\\r\\n\\r\\ni shall not trouble you with a relation of the common accidents of our\\r\\njourney, which lasted two months and better, nor with the different\\r\\nmethods we used to get subsistence, but shall at once conduct you to\\r\\nquamis; only mentioning that we were sometimes obliged to go about, and\\r\\nwere once stopped by a cut that my guide and companion received by a\\r\\nragged stone in his foot, which growing very bad, almost deprived me of\\r\\nthe hopes of his life; but by rest and constant sucking and licking it,\\r\\nwhich was the only remedy we had to apply, except green leaves chewed,\\r\\nthat i laid to it by his direction, to supple and cool it, he soon began\\r\\nto be able to ride upon the muletto, and sometimes to walk a little.\\r\\n\\r\\ni say we arrived at quamis, a small place on a river of that name, where\\r\\nglanlepze had a neat dwelling, and left a wife and five children when\\r\\nhe went out to the wars. we were very near the town when the day closed;\\r\\nand as it is soon dark there after sunset, you could but just see\\r\\nyour hand at our entrance into it we met nobody in the way, but i went\\r\\ndirectly to glanlepze\\'s door, by his direction, and struck two or three\\r\\nstrokes hard against it with my stick. on this there came a woman to\\r\\nit stark-naked. i asked her, in her own language, if she knew one\\r\\nglanlepze. she told me, with a deep sigh, that once she did. i asked\\r\\nthen where he was. she said, with their ancestors, she hoped, for he\\r\\nwas the greatest warrior in the world; but if he was not dead, he was\\r\\nin slavery. now you must know glanlepze had a mind to hear how his wife\\r\\ntook his death or slavery, and had put me upon asking these questions\\r\\nbefore he discovered himself. i proceeded then to tell her i brought\\r\\nsome news of glanlepze, and was lately come from him, and by his order.\\r\\n\"and does my dear glanlepze live!\" says she, flying upon my neck, and\\r\\nalmost smothering me with caresses, till i begged her to forbear, or she\\r\\nwould strangle me, and i had a great deal more to tell her; then ringing\\r\\nfor a light, when she saw i was a white man she seemed in the utmost\\r\\nconfusion at her own nakedness; and immediately retiring, she threw a\\r\\ncloth round her waist and came to me again. i then repeated to her that\\r\\nher husband was alive and well, but wanted a ransom to redeem himself,\\r\\nand had sent me to see what she could anyways raise for that purpose.\\r\\nshe told me she and her children had lived very hardly ever since he\\r\\nwent from her, and she had nothing to sell, or make money of, but her\\r\\nfive children; that as this was the time for the slaving-trade, she\\r\\nwould see what she could raise by them, and if that would not do, she\\r\\nwould sell herself and send him the money, if he would let her know how\\r\\nto do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nglanlepze, who heard every word that passed, finding so strong a proof\\r\\nof his wife\\'s affection, could hold out no longer, but bursting into the\\r\\nroom, clasped her in his arms, crying, \"no, zulika! (for that was\\r\\nher name) i am free; there will be no occasion for your or my dear\\r\\nchildren\\'s slavery, and rather than have purchased my freedom at that\\r\\nrate, i would willingly have died a slave myself. but my own ears have\\r\\nheard the tender sentiments my zulika has for me.\" then, drowned in\\r\\ntears of joy, they embraced each other so close and so long, that i\\r\\nthought it impertinent to be seen with them till their first transports\\r\\nwere over. so i retired without the house, till glanlepze called me in,\\r\\nwhich was not less than full half an hour. i admired at the love and\\r\\nconstancy of the person i had just left behind me; and, good heaven,\\r\\nthinks i to myself, with a sigh, how happy has this our escape rendered\\r\\nglanlepze and his wife! what a mutual felicity do they feel! and what\\r\\nis the cause of all this? is it that he has brought home great treasures\\r\\nfrom the wars? nothing like it; he is come naked. is it that, having\\r\\nescaped slavery and poverty, he is returned to an opulent wife,\\r\\nabounding with the good things of life? no such thing. what, then, can\\r\\nbe the cause of this excess of satisfaction, this alternate joy, that\\r\\npatty and i could not have been as happy with each other? why, it was my\\r\\npride that interposed and prevented it. but what am i like to get by\\r\\nit, and by all this travel and these hazards? is this the way to make\\r\\na fortune, to get an estate? no, surely the very contrary. i could not,\\r\\nforsooth, labour for patty and her children where i was known; but am i\\r\\nany better for labouring here where i am not known, where i have nobody\\r\\nto assist me, than i could have been where i am known, and where there\\r\\nwould have been my friends about me, at least, if they could have\\r\\nafforded no great assistance? i have been deceived, then, and have\\r\\ntravelled so many thousand miles, and undergone so many dangers, only to\\r\\nknow at last i had been happier at home; and have doubled my misery for\\r\\nwant of consideration--that very consideration which, impartially\\r\\ntaken, would have convinced me i ought to have made the best of my bad\\r\\ncircumstances, and to have laid hold of every commendable method of\\r\\nimproving them. did i come hither to avoid daily labour or voluntary\\r\\nservitude at home? i have had it in abundance. did i come hither to\\r\\navoid poverty or contempt? here i have met with them tenfold and now,\\r\\nafter all, was i to return home empty and naked, as glanlepze has done,\\r\\nshould i meet a wife, as bare as myself, so ready to die in my embraces,\\r\\nand to be a slave herself, with her children, for my sake only? i fear\\r\\nnot.\\r\\n\\r\\nthese and the like reflections had taken possession of me when glanlepze\\r\\ncalled me in; where i found his wife, in her manner, preparing our\\r\\nsupper, with all that cheerfulness which gives a true lustre to\\r\\ninnocence.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe bustle we made had by this time awakened the children; who,\\r\\nstark-naked as they were born, both boys and girls, came crawling out,\\r\\nblack as jet, from behind a curtain at the farther end of the room,\\r\\nwhich was very long. the father as yet had only inquired after them;\\r\\nbut upon sight of them he fell into an ecstasy, kissing one, stroking\\r\\nanother, dandling a third, for the eldest was scarce fourteen; but\\r\\nnot one of them knew him, for seven years makes a great chasm in young\\r\\nmemories. the more i saw of this sport, the stronger impression patty\\r\\nand my own children made upon me. my mind had been so much employed on\\r\\nmy own distresses, that those dear ideas were almost effaced; but this\\r\\nmoving scene introduced them afresh, and imprinted them deeply on my\\r\\nimagination, which cherished the sweet remembrance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter viii.\\r\\n\\r\\n     how the author passed his time with glanlepze--his\\r\\n     acquaintance with some english prisoners--they project an\\r\\n     escape--he joins them--they seize a portuguese ship and get\\r\\n     off.--make a long run from land--want water--they anchor at\\r\\n     a desert island--the boat goes on shore for water--they\\r\\n     lose their anchor in a storm--the author and one adams drove\\r\\n     to sea--a miraculous passage to a rock--adams drowned there--\\r\\n     the author\\'s miserable condition\\r\\n\\r\\ni passed my time with glanlepze and his wife, who both really loved\\r\\nme, with sufficient bodily quiet, for about two years: my business\\r\\nwas chiefly, in company with my patron, to cultivate a spot of ground\\r\\nwherein we had planted grain and necessaries for the family; and once or\\r\\ntwice a week we went a fishing, and sometimes hunted and shot venison.\\r\\nthese were our chief employments; for as to excursions for slaves, which\\r\\nis a practice in many of those countries, and what the natives get money\\r\\nby, since our own slavery, glanlepze and i could not endure it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthough i was tolerably easy in my external circumstances, yet my mind\\r\\nhankering after england made my life still: unhappy; and that infelicity\\r\\ndaily increased as i saw the less probability of attaining my desire. at\\r\\nlength, hearing of some european sailors who were under confinement for\\r\\ncontraband trade at a portuguese fort about two miles from quamis, i\\r\\nresolved to go to see them; and if any of them should be english, at\\r\\nleast to inquire after my native country. i went and found two dutchmen\\r\\nwho had been sailors in british pay several years, three scotchmen,\\r\\nan irishman, and five englishmen, but all had been long in english\\r\\nmerchants\\' service. they were taken, as they told me, by a portuguese\\r\\nvessel, together with their ship, as a dutch prize under pretence of\\r\\ncontraband trade. the captain was known to be a dutchman, though he\\r\\nspoke good english, and was then in english pay and his vessel english;\\r\\ntherefore they would have it that he was a dutch trader, and so seized\\r\\nhis ship in the harbour, with the prisoners in it the captain, who was\\r\\non shore with several of his men, was threatened to be laid in irons if\\r\\nhe was taken, which obliged him and his men to abscond, and fly overland\\r\\nto an english factory for assistance to recover his ship and cargo;\\r\\nbeing afraid to appear and claim it amongst so many enemies without an\\r\\nadditional force. they had been in confinement two months, and their\\r\\nship confiscated and sold. in this miserable condition i left them, but\\r\\nreturned once or twice a week for a fortnight or three weeks to visit\\r\\nthem. these instances of regard, as they thought them, created some\\r\\nconfidence in me, so that they conversed with me very freely. amongst\\r\\nother discourse, they told me one day that one of their crew who went\\r\\nwith the captain had been taken ill on the way, and being unable to\\r\\nproceed, was returned; but as he talked good portuguese, he was not\\r\\nsuspected to belong to them; and that he had been to visit them, and\\r\\nwould be there again that day. i had a mind to see him, so stayed longer\\r\\nthan i intended, and in about an hour\\'s time he came. after he was\\r\\nseated he asked who i was, and (privately) if i might be trusted. being\\r\\nsatisfied i might, for that i was a cornish man, he began as follows,\\r\\nlooking narrowly about to see he was not overheard: \"my lads,\" says he,\\r\\n\"be of good courage; i have hopes for you; be but men and we shall see\\r\\nbetter days yet.\" i wondered to what this preface tended, when he told\\r\\nus that since his return from the captain, as he spoke good portuguese\\r\\nand had sailed on board portuguese traders several years, he mixed among\\r\\nthat people, and particularly among the crew of the \"del cruz,\" the ship\\r\\nwhich had taken them; that that ship had partly unloaded, and was taking\\r\\nin other goods for a future voyage; that he had informed himself of\\r\\ntheir strength, and that very seldom more than three men and two boys\\r\\nlay on board; that he had hired himself to the captain, and was to go\\r\\non board the very next day. \"now,\" says he, \"my lads, if you can break\\r\\nprison any night after to-morrow, and come directly to the ship (telling\\r\\nthem how she lay, for, says he, you cannot mistake, you will find two\\r\\nor three boats moored in the gut against the church), i will be ready to\\r\\nreceive you, and we will get off with her in lieu of our ship they have\\r\\ntaken from us, for there is nothing ready to follow us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe prisoners listened to this discourse very attentively; but scratched\\r\\ntheir heads, fearing the difficulty of it, and severer usage if they\\r\\nmiscarried, and made several objections; but at last they all swore to\\r\\nattempt it the night but one following. upon which the sailor went away\\r\\nto prepare for their reception on board. after he was gone, i surveyed\\r\\nhis scheme attentively in my own mind, and found it not so difficult as\\r\\ni first imagined, if the prisoners could but escape cleverly. so before\\r\\ni went away i told them i approved of their purpose; and as i was their\\r\\ncountryman, i was resolved, with their leaves, to risk my fortune with\\r\\nthem. at this they seemed much pleased, and all embraced me. we then\\r\\nfixed the peremptory night, and i was to wait at the water-side and get\\r\\nthe boats in readiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe prison they were in was a portuguese fort, which had been deserted\\r\\never since the building a much better on the other side of the river, a\\r\\ngunshot lower. it was built with walls too thick for naked men to storm;\\r\\nthe captives were securely locked up every night; and two soldiers,\\r\\nor sentinels, kept watch in an outer-room, who were relieved from the\\r\\nmain-guard in the body of the building.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe expected night arrived, and a little before midnight, as had been\\r\\nconcerted, one of the prisoners cried out he was so parched up he was on\\r\\nfire, he was on fire! the sentinels were both asleep, but the first that\\r\\nwaked called at the door to know what was the matter. the prisoner still\\r\\ncrying out, \"i am on fire!\" the rest begged the sentinel to bring a bowl\\r\\nof water for him, for they knew not what ailed him.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe good-natured fellow, without waking his companion, brought the\\r\\nwater, and having a lamp in the guard-room, opened the door; when the\\r\\nprisoners seizing his arms, and commanding him to silence, bound his\\r\\nhands behind him, and his feet together; then serving the other in the\\r\\nsame manner, who was now just awake, and taking from them their swords\\r\\nand muskets, they made the best of their way over the fort wall; which\\r\\nbeing built with buttresses on the inside was easily surmounted. being\\r\\ngot out, they were not long in finding me, who had before this time made\\r\\nthe boats ready and was impatiently waiting for them; so in we all got\\r\\nand made good speed to the ship, where we were welcomed by our companion\\r\\nready to receive us.\\r\\n\\r\\nunder pretence of being a new-entered sailor, he had carried some\\r\\nmadeira wine on board, and treated the men and boys so freely that he\\r\\nhad thrown them into a dead sleep, which was a wise precaution. there\\r\\nbeing now, therefore, no fear of disturbance or interruption, we drew up\\r\\nthe two boats and set all hands at work to put the ship under way; and\\r\\nplied it so closely, the wind favouring us, that by eleven o\\'clock the\\r\\nnext morning we were out of sight of land; but we set the men and boys\\r\\nadrift, in one of the boats, nigh the mouth of the river.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe first thing we did after we had made a long run from shore was to\\r\\nconsult what course to steer. now, as there was a valuable loading on\\r\\nboard of goods from portugal and others taken in since, some gave their\\r\\nopinion for sailing directly for india, selling the ship and cargo there\\r\\nand returning by some english vessel; but that was rejected; for we did\\r\\nnot doubt but notice would be given of our escape along the coast, and\\r\\nif we should fall into the portuguese\\'s hands, we could expect no mercy;\\r\\nbesides, we had not people sufficient for such an enterprise. others,\\r\\nagain, were for sailing the directest course for england; but i told\\r\\nthem, as our opinions were different, and no time was to be lost, my\\r\\nadvice was to stretch southward till we might be quite out of fear of\\r\\npursuit, and then, whatever course we took, by keeping clear of all\\r\\ncoasts, we might hope to come safe off.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy proposal seemed to please the whole crew; so crowding all the sail\\r\\nwe could, we pushed southwards very briskly before the wind for several\\r\\ndays. we now went upon examining our stores, and found we had flour\\r\\nenough, plenty of fish and salt provisions, but were scant of water and\\r\\nwood; of the first whereof there was not half a ton, and but very little\\r\\nof the latter. this made us very uneasy, and being none of us expert in\\r\\nnavigation farther than the common working of the ship, and having no\\r\\nchart on board that might direct us to the nearest land, we were almost\\r\\nat our wits\\' end, and came to a short allowance of liquor. that we must\\r\\nget water if we could was indisputable; but where to do it puzzled us,\\r\\nas we had determined not to get in with the african shore on any account\\r\\nwhatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nin this perplexity, and under the guidance of different opinions (for\\r\\nwe were all captains now), we sometimes steered eastward, and sometimes\\r\\nwestward, for about nine days, when we espied a little bluish cloud-like\\r\\nappearance to the southwest; this continuing, we hoped it might be land,\\r\\nand therefore made to it. upon our nearer approach we found it to be,\\r\\nas we judged, an island; but not knowing its name or whether it was\\r\\ninhabited, we coasted round it two days to satisfy ourselves as to this\\r\\nlast particular. seeing no living creature on it during that time, and\\r\\nthe shore being very broken, we came to an anchor about two miles from\\r\\nit, and sent ten of our crew in our best boat with some casks to get\\r\\nwater and cut wood. the boat returned at night with six men and the\\r\\ncasks filled, having left four behind to go on with the cutting of wood\\r\\nagainst next day. accordingly next morning the boat went off again and\\r\\nmade two turns with water and wood ere night, which was repeated for two\\r\\nor three days after. on the sixth she went off for wood only, leaving\\r\\nnone but me and one john adams on board.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe boat had scarce reached the island this last turn before the day\\r\\novercast, and there arose such a storm of wind, thunder, lightning, and\\r\\nhail as i had never before seen. at last our cable broke close to the\\r\\nanchor, and away we went with the wind full southward by west; and not\\r\\nhaving strength to keep the ship upon a side wind, we were forced to set\\r\\nher head right before it and let her drive. our hope was, every hour,\\r\\nthe storm would abate; but it continued with equal violence for many\\r\\ndays, during all which time neither adams nor i had any rest, for one or\\r\\nother of us was forced, and sometimes both, to keep her right before the\\r\\nwind, or she would certainly have overset. when the storm abated, as it\\r\\ndid by degrees, neither adams nor i could tell where we were, or in what\\r\\npart of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\ni was sorry i had no better a sailor with me, for neither adams nor\\r\\nmyself had ever made more than one voyage till now, so that we were both\\r\\nunacquainted with the latitude, and scarce knew the use of the compass\\r\\nto any purpose; and being out of all hope of ever reaching the island to\\r\\nour companions, we neither knew which way to steer, nor what to do; and\\r\\nindeed had we known where we were, we two only could not have been\\r\\nable to navigate the ship to any part we desired, or ever to get to the\\r\\nisland, unless such a wind as we had before would of itself have driven\\r\\nus thither.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhilst we were considering, day after day, what to do, though the sea\\r\\nwas now very calm and smooth, the ship seemed to sail at as great a rate\\r\\nas before, which we attributed to the velocity she had acquired by\\r\\nthe storm, or to currents that had set that way by the violence of the\\r\\nwinds. contenting ourselves with this, we expected all soon to be right\\r\\nagain; and as we had no prospect of ever seeing our companions, we kept\\r\\nthe best look-out we could to see for any vessel coming that course\\r\\nwhich might take us in, and resolved to rest all our hopes upon that.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we had sailed a good while after this manner, we knew not whither,\\r\\nadams called out, \"i see land!\" my heart leapt within me for joy, and\\r\\nwe hoped the current that seemed to carry us so fast set in for some\\r\\nislands or rivers that lay before us. but still we were exceedingly\\r\\npuzzled at the ship\\'s making such way, and the nearer we approached the\\r\\nland, which was now very visible, the more speed the ship made, though\\r\\nthere was no wind stirring. we had but just time to think on this\\r\\nunexpected phenomenon, when we found that what we had taken for land was\\r\\na rock of an extraordinary height, to which, as we advanced nearer,\\r\\nthe ship increased its motion, and all our strength could not make her\\r\\nanswer her rudder any other way. this put us under the apprehension\\r\\nof being dashed to pieces immediately, and in less than half an hour i\\r\\nverily thought my fears had not been groundless. poor adams told me he\\r\\nwould try when the ship struck if he could leap upon the rock, and ran\\r\\nto the head for that purpose; but i was so fearful of seeing my danger\\r\\nthat i ran under hatches, resolving to sink in the ship. we had no\\r\\nsooner parted but i felt so violent a shock that i verily thought the\\r\\nship had brought down the whole rock upon her, and been thereby dashed\\r\\nto pieces, so that i never more expected to see the light.\\r\\n\\r\\ni lay under this terror for at least half an hour, waiting the ship\\'s\\r\\neither filling with water or bulging every moment. but finding neither\\r\\nmotion in her nor any water rise, nor the least noise whatsoever, i\\r\\nventured with an aching heart from my retreat, and stole up the hatchway\\r\\nas if an enemy had been on deck, peeping first one way then another.\\r\\nhere nothing presented but confusion, the rock hung over the hatchway\\r\\nat about twenty feet above my head, our foremast lay by the board, the\\r\\nmainmast yard-arm was down, and great part of the mainmast snapped\\r\\noff with it, and almost everything upon deck was displaced. this sight\\r\\nshocked me extremely; and calling for adams, in whom i hoped to find\\r\\nsome comfort, i was too soon convinced i had lost him.\\r\\n\\r\\nwilkins thinks of destroying himself--his soliloquy--strange accident in\\r\\nthe hold--his surprise--cannot climb the rock--his method to sweeten his\\r\\nwater--lives many months on board---ventures to sea in his boat several\\r\\ntimes, and takes many fish--almost overcome by an eel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter ix.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter i had stood a while in the utmost confusion of thought, and my\\r\\nspirits began to be a little composed, i was resolved to see what damage\\r\\nthe hull of the ship had received. accordingly i looked narrowly, but\\r\\ncould find none, only she was immovably fixed in a cleft of the\\r\\nrock, like a large archway, and there stuck so fast, that though upon\\r\\nfathoming i could find no bottom, she never moved in the least by the\\r\\nworking of the water.\\r\\n\\r\\ni now began to look upon adams as a happy man, being delivered by an\\r\\nimmediate death from such an inextricable scene of distress, and wished\\r\\nmyself with him a thousand times. i had a great mind to have followed\\r\\nhim into the other world; yet i know not how it is, there is something\\r\\nso abhorrent to human nature in self-murder, be one\\'s condition what\\r\\nit will, that i was soon determined on the contrary side. now again i\\r\\nperceived that the almighty had given me a large field to expatiate in\\r\\nupon the trial of his creatures, by bringing them into imminent dangers\\r\\nready to overwhelm them, and at the same time, as it were, hanging out\\r\\nthe flag of truce and mercy to them. these thoughts brought me to my\\r\\nknees, and i poured out my soul to god in a strain of humiliation,\\r\\nresignation to his will, and earnest petitions for deliverance or\\r\\nsupport in this distress. having finished, i found myself in a more\\r\\ncomposed frame; so having eaten a biscuit and drank a can of water, and\\r\\nnot seeing anything to be done whereby i could better my condition, i\\r\\nsat me down upon the deck, and fell into the following soliloquy--\\r\\n\\r\\npeter, says i, what have you to do here?--alas! replied i to myself, i\\r\\nam fixed against my will in this dismal mansion, destined, as rats might\\r\\nbe, to devour the provisions only, and having eaten all up, to perish\\r\\nwith hunger for want of a supply.--then, says i, of what use are you in\\r\\nthe world, peter?--truly, answered i, of no other use that i can see but\\r\\nto be an object of misery for divine vengeance to work upon, and to show\\r\\nwhat a deplorable state human nature can be reduced to; for i cannot\\r\\nthink any one else can be so wretched.--and again, peter, says i, what\\r\\nhave you been doing ever since you came into the world?--i am afraid,\\r\\nsays i, i can answer no better to this question than to either of the\\r\\nformer; for if only reasonable actions are to be reckoned among my\\r\\ndoings, i am sure i have done little worth recording; for let me see\\r\\nwhat it all amounts to. i spent my first sixteen years in making a fool\\r\\nof my mother; my three next in letting her make a fool of me, and in\\r\\nbeing fool enough myself to get me a wife and two children before i was\\r\\ntwenty. the next year was spent in finding out the misery of slavery\\r\\nfrom experience. two years more i repined at the happiness of my\\r\\nbenefactor, and at finding it was not my lot to enjoy the same. this\\r\\nyear is not yet spent, and how many more are to come, and where they may\\r\\nbe passed, and what they may produce, requires a better head than mine\\r\\neven to guess at; but certainly my present situation seems to promise\\r\\nnothing beside woe and misery.--but hold a little, says i, and let me\\r\\nclearly state my own wretchedness. i am here, it is true; but for any\\r\\ngood i have ever done or any advantage i have reaped in other places, i\\r\\nam as well here as anywhere. i have no present want of food or unjust\\r\\nor cruel enemy to annoy me; so as long as the ship continues entire\\r\\nand provisions last, i shall do tolerably. then why should i grieve\\r\\nor terrify myself about what may come? what my frighted imagination\\r\\nsuggests may perhaps never happen. deliverance, though not to be looked\\r\\nfor, is yet possible; and my future fate may be as different from\\r\\nmy present condition as this is from the hopes with which i lately\\r\\nflattered myself. and why, after all, may i not die a natural death\\r\\nhere as well as anywhere? all mankind die, and then there is an end of\\r\\nall----an end of all! did i say? no, there is something within that\\r\\ngives me the lie when i say so. let me see; death, my master used to\\r\\nsay, is not an end, but a beginning of real life: and may it not be so?\\r\\nmay i not as well undergo a change from this to a different state of\\r\\nlife when i leave this world, as be born into it i know not from whence?\\r\\nwho sent me into this world? who framed me of two natures so unlike,\\r\\nthat death cannot destroy but one of them? it must be the almighty god.\\r\\nbut all god\\'s works tend to some end; and if he has given me an immortal\\r\\nnature, it must be his intention that i should live somewhere and\\r\\nsomehow for ever. may not this stage of being then be only an\\r\\nintroduction to a preparative for another? there is nothing in this\\r\\nsupposition repugnant to reason. upon the whole, if god is the author of\\r\\nmy being, he only has a right to dispose of it, and i may not put an end\\r\\nthereto without his leave. it is no less true that my continuing therein\\r\\nduring his pleasure, and because it is so, may turn vastly to my\\r\\nadvantage in his good time; it may be the means of my becoming happy for\\r\\neven when it is his will that i go hence. it is no less probable that,\\r\\ndismal as my present circumstances appear, i may be even now the object\\r\\nof a kind providence: god may be leading me by affliction to repentance\\r\\nof former crimes; destroying those sensual affections that have all my\\r\\ndays kept me from loving and serving him. i will therefore submit myself\\r\\nto his will, and hope for his mercy.\\r\\n\\r\\nthese thoughts, and many others i then had, composed me very much, and\\r\\nby degrees reconciled me to my destined solitude. i walked my ship, of\\r\\nwhich i was now both master and owner, and employed myself in searching\\r\\nhow it was fastened to the rock, and where it rested; but all to no\\r\\npurpose as to that particular. i then struck a light and went into the\\r\\nhold, to see what i could find useful, for we had never searched the\\r\\nship since we took her.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the hold i found abundance of long iron bars, which i suppose were\\r\\nbrought out to be trafficked with the blacks. i observed they lay\\r\\nall with one end close to the head of the ship, which i presumed was\\r\\noccasioned by the violent shock they received when she struck against\\r\\nthe rock; but seeing one short bar lying out beyond the rest, though\\r\\ntouching at the end of one of the long bars, i thought to take it up,\\r\\nand lay it on the heap with the others; but the moment i had raised\\r\\nthe end next the other bars, it flew out of my hand with such violence,\\r\\nagainst the head of the ship, and with such a noise, as greatly\\r\\nsurprised me, and put me in fear it had broke through the plank.\\r\\n\\r\\ni just stayed to see no harm was done, and ran upon deck with my hair\\r\\nstiff on my head; nor could i conceive less than that some subtle spirit\\r\\nhad done this prank merely to terrify me.\\r\\n\\r\\nit ran in my pate several days, and i durst upon no account have gone\\r\\ninto the hold again, though my whole support had lain there; nay, it\\r\\neven spoiled my rest, for fear something tragical should befall me, of\\r\\nwhich this amazing incident was an omen.\\r\\n\\r\\nabout a week after, as i was shifting myself (for i had not taken my\\r\\nclothes off since i came there), and putting on a new pair of shoes\\r\\nwhich i found on board, my own being very bad, taking out my iron\\r\\nbuckles, i laid one of them upon a broken piece of the mast that i sat\\r\\nupon; when to my astonishment, it was no sooner out of my hand but up it\\r\\nflew to the rock and stuck there. i could not tell what to make of it,\\r\\nbut was sorry the devil had got above deck. i then held several other\\r\\nthings one after another in my hand, and laid them down where i laid the\\r\\nbuckle, but nothing stirred till i took out the fellow of that from the\\r\\nshoes; when letting it go away, it jumped also to the rock.\\r\\n\\r\\ni mused on these phenomena for some time, and could not forbear calling\\r\\nupon god to protect me from the devil; who must, as i imagined, have\\r\\na hand in such unaccountable things as they then seemed to me. but at\\r\\nlength reason got the better of these foolish apprehensions, and i began\\r\\nto think there might be some natural cause of them, and next to be\\r\\nvery desirous of finding it out in order to this i set about making\\r\\nexperiments to try what would run to the rock and what would not. i went\\r\\ninto the captain\\'s cabin, and opening a cupboard, of which the key was\\r\\nin the door, i took out a pipe, a bottle, a pocket-book, a silver spoon,\\r\\na tea-cup, &c, and laid them successively near the rock; when none of\\r\\nthem answered, but the key which i had brought out of the cupboard on\\r\\nmy finger dropping off while i was thus employed, no sooner was it\\r\\ndisengaged but away it went to it. after that i tried several other\\r\\npieces of iron-ware with the like success. upon this, and the needle of\\r\\nmy compass standing stiff to the rock, i concluded that this same rock\\r\\ncontained great quantity of loadstone, or was itself one vast magnet,\\r\\nand that our lading of iron was the cause of the ship\\'s violent course\\r\\nthereto, which i mentioned before.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis quite satisfied me as to my notions of spirits, and gave me a more\\r\\nundisturbed night\\'s rest than i had had before, so that now, having\\r\\nnothing to affright me, i passed the time tolerably well in my solitude,\\r\\nas it grew by degrees familiar to me.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had often wished it had been possible for me to climb the rock, but\\r\\nit was so smooth in many places and craggy in others, and over-hanging,\\r\\ncontinuing just the same to the right and left of me as far as ever i\\r\\ncould see, that from the impossibility of it, i discharged all thoughts\\r\\nof such an attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had now lived on board three months, and perceived the days grow\\r\\nshorter and shorter, till, having lost the sun for a little time, they\\r\\nwere quite dark: that is, there was no absolute daylight, or indeed\\r\\nvisible distinction between day and night; though it was never so dark\\r\\nbut i could see well enough upon deck to go about.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhat now concerned me the most was my water, which began to grow very\\r\\nbad (though i had plenty of it) and unsavoury, so that i could scarce\\r\\ndrink it, but had no prospect of better. now and then indeed it snowed\\r\\na little, which i made some use of, but this was far from contenting me.\\r\\nhereupon i began to contrive; and having nothing else to do, i set two\\r\\nopen vessels upon deck, and drawing water from the hold i filled one of\\r\\nmy vessels, and letting it stand a day and a night i poured it into the\\r\\nother, and so shifted it every twenty-four hours; this, i found, though\\r\\nit did not bring it to the primitive taste and render it altogether\\r\\npalatable, was nevertheless a great help to it, by incorporating the\\r\\nfresh air with it, so that it became very potable, and this method i\\r\\nconstantly used with my drinking-water, so long as i stayed on board the\\r\\nship.\\r\\n\\r\\nit had now been sharp weather for some time, and the cold still\\r\\nincreasing, this put me upon rummaging the ship farther than ever i\\r\\nthought to do before; when opening a little cabin under deck, i found a\\r\\nlarge cargo of fine french brandy, a great many bottles, and some small\\r\\ncasks of madeira wine, with divers cordial waters. having tasted these,\\r\\nand taken out a bottle or two of brandy, and some madeira, i locked up\\r\\nmy door and looked no farther that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next day i inquired into my provisions, and some of my flesh having\\r\\nsoaked out the pickle, i made fresh pickle and closed it up again. i\\r\\nthat day also found several cheeses cased up in lead, one of which i\\r\\nthen opened and dined upon: but what time of day or night it was when i\\r\\neat this meal i could not tell. i found a great many chests well filled,\\r\\nand one or two of tools which some years after stood me in a very good\\r\\nstead, though i did not expect they would ever be of that service when i\\r\\nfirst met with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nin this manner i spent my time till i began to see broad daylight again,\\r\\nwhich cheered me greatly. i had been often put in hopes during the dark\\r\\nseason that ships were coming towards me, and that i should once more\\r\\nhave the conversation of mankind, for i had by the small glimmering seen\\r\\nmany large bodies (to my thinking) move at a little distance from me,\\r\\nand particularly toward the reappearing of the light, but though i\\r\\nhallooed as loud as i could, and often fired my gun, i never received an\\r\\nanswer.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen the light returned, my days increased in proportion as they had\\r\\nbefore decreased; and gathering comfort from that, i determined to\\r\\nlaunch my small boat and to coast along the island, as i judged it, to\\r\\nsee if it was inhabited and by whom; i determined also to make me some\\r\\nlines for fishing, and carry my gun to try for other game, if i found\\r\\na place for landing; for though i had never, since my arrival, seen a\\r\\nsingle living creature but my cat, except insects, of which there were\\r\\nmany in the water and in the air before the dark weather, and then began\\r\\nto appear again, yet i could not but think there were both birds and\\r\\nbeasts to be met with.\\r\\n\\r\\nupon launching my boat i perceived she was very leaky, so i let her fill\\r\\nand continue thus a week or more to stop her cracks, then getting down\\r\\nthe side of my ship i scooped her quite dry and found her very fit for\\r\\nuse; so putting on board my gun, lines, brandy bottles, and clothes\\r\\nchest for a seat, with some little water and provisions for a week, i\\r\\nonce more committed myself to the sea, having taken all the observation\\r\\ni could to gain my ship again if any accident should happen, though i\\r\\nresolved upon no account to quit sight of the rock willingly.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had not rowed very long before i thought i saw an island to my right\\r\\nabout a league distant, to which i inclined to steer my course, the sea\\r\\nbeing very calm; but upon surveying it nearer, i found it only a great\\r\\ncake of ice, about forty yards high above the water and a mile or two\\r\\nin length. i then concluded that what i had before taken for ships were\\r\\nonly these lumps of ice. being thus disappointed as to my island, i\\r\\nmade what haste i could back to the rock again and coasted part of\\r\\nits circumference; but though i had gone two or three leagues of its\\r\\ncircuit, the prospect it afforded was just the same.\\r\\n\\r\\ni then tried my lines by fastening several very long ones, made of the\\r\\nlog-line, to the side of the boat, baiting them with several different\\r\\nbaits, but took only one fish of about four pounds weight, very much\\r\\nresembling a haddock, part of which i dressed for my supper after my\\r\\nreturn to the ship, and it proved very good. towards evening i returned\\r\\nto my home, as i may call it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next day i made a voyage on the other side of the rock, though but\\r\\nto a small distance from the ship, with intent only to fish, but took\\r\\nnothing. i had then a mind to victual my boat or little cruiser, and\\r\\nprepare myself for a voyage of two or three days, which i thought i\\r\\nmight safely undertake, as i had never seen a troubled sea since i came\\r\\nto the island; for though i heard the wind often roaring over my head,\\r\\nyet it coming always from the land-side, it never disturbed the water\\r\\nnear the shore. i set out the same way i went at first, designing to\\r\\nsail two or three days out and as many home again, and resolved if\\r\\npossible to fathom the depth as i went. with this view i prepared a very\\r\\nlong line with a large shot tied in a rag at the end of it, by way of\\r\\nplummet, but i felt no ground till the second night the next morning i\\r\\ncame into thirty fathom water, then twenty, then sixteen. in both tours\\r\\ni could perceive no abatement in the height or steepness of the rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nin about fourteen fathom water i dropped my lines, and lay by for an\\r\\nhour or two. feeling several jars as i sat on my chest in the boat, i\\r\\nwas sure i had caught somewhat, so pulling up my lines successively, i\\r\\nbrought first a large eel near six feet long and almost as thick as my\\r\\nthigh, whose mouth, throat, and fins, were of a fine scarlet, and\\r\\nthe belly as white as snow: he was so strong while in the water, and\\r\\nweighty, i had much ado to get him into the boat, and then had a harder\\r\\njob to kill him; for though, having a hatchet with me to cut wood in\\r\\ncase i met with any landing-place, i chopped off his head the moment i\\r\\nhad him on board, yet he had several times after that have like to have\\r\\nbroken my legs and beat me overboard before i had quite taken his life\\r\\nfrom him, and had i not whipped off his tail and also divided his body\\r\\ninto two or three pieces, i could not have mastered him. the next i\\r\\npulled up was a thick fish like a tench, but of another colour and much\\r\\nbigger. i drew up several others, flat and long fish, till i was tired\\r\\nwith the sport; and then i set out for the ship again, which i reached\\r\\nthe third day.\\r\\n\\r\\nduring this whole time, i had but one shot, and that was as i came\\r\\nhomewards, at a creature i saw upon a high crag of the rock, which i\\r\\nfired at with ball, fearing that my small shot would not reach it the\\r\\nanimal, being mortally wounded, bounded up, and came tumbling down the\\r\\nrock, very near me. i picked it up, and found it to be a creature not\\r\\nmuch unlike our rabbits, but with shorter ears, a longer tail, and\\r\\nhoofed like a kid, though it had the perfect fluck of a rabbit i put it\\r\\ninto my boat, to contemplate on when i arrived at the ship; and, plying\\r\\nmy oars, got safe, as i said, on the third day.\\r\\n\\r\\ni made me a fire to cook with as soon as i had got my cargo out of the\\r\\nboat into my ship, but was under debate which of my dainties to begin\\r\\nupon. i had sometimes a mind to have broiled my rabbit, as i called it,\\r\\nand boiled some of my fish; but being tired, i hung up my flesh till\\r\\nthe next day, and boiled two or three sorts of my fish, to try which was\\r\\nbest. i knew not the nature of most of them, so i boiled a piece of my\\r\\neel, to be sure, judging that, however i might like the others, i should\\r\\ncertainly be able to make a good meal of that. this variety being ready,\\r\\ni took a little of my oil out of the hold for sauce, and sat down to my\\r\\nmeal, as satisfied as an emperor. but upon tasting my several messes,\\r\\nthough the eel was rather richer than the smaller fishes, yet the others\\r\\nwere all so good, i gave them the preference for that time, and laid by\\r\\nthe rest of the eel, and of the other fish, till the next day, when i\\r\\nsalted them for future use.\\r\\n\\r\\ni kept now a whole week or more at home, to look farther into the\\r\\ncontents of the ship, bottle off a cask of madeira, which i found\\r\\nleaking, and to consume my new stores of fish and flesh, which, being\\r\\nsomewhat stale when first salted, i thought would not keep so well as\\r\\nthe old ones that were on board. i added also some fresh bread to my\\r\\nprovision, and sweetened more water by the aforementioned method; and\\r\\nwhen my necessary domestic affairs were brought under, i then projected\\r\\na new voyage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter x.\\r\\n\\r\\n     lays in great store of provisions--resolves to traverse the\\r\\n     rock--sails for three weeks, still seeing it only--is sucked\\r\\n     under the rock, and hurried down a cataract--continues there\\r\\n     five weeks--his description of the cavern--his thoughts and\\r\\n     difficulties--his arrival at a great lake--and his landing\\r\\n     in the beautiful country of graundevolet\\r\\n\\r\\ni had for a long time wanted to see the other side of the rock, and\\r\\nat last resolved to try if i could not coast it quite round; for, as\\r\\ni reasoned with myself, i might possibly find some landing-places, and\\r\\nperhaps a convenient habitation on shore. but as i was very uncertain\\r\\nwhat time that might take up, i determined on having provisions,\\r\\ninstruments of divers kinds, and necessary utensils in plenty, to guard\\r\\nagainst accidents as well as i could. i therefore took another sea-chest\\r\\nout of the hold of the ship, and letting it into my boat, replenished it\\r\\nwith a stock of wine, brandy, oil, bread, and the like, sufficient for\\r\\na considerable voyage. i also filled a large cask with water, and took\\r\\na good quantity of salt to cure what fish i should take by the way. i\\r\\ncarried two guns, two brace of pistols, and other arms, with ammunition\\r\\nproportionable; also an axe or two, a saw to cut wood if i should see\\r\\nany, and a few other tools, which might be highly serviceable if i could\\r\\nland. to all these i added an old sail, to make a covering for my goods\\r\\nand artillery against the weather. thus furnished and equipped, having\\r\\nsecured my hatches on board, and everything that might spoil by wet, i\\r\\nset out, with a god\\'s speed, on my expedition, committing myself once\\r\\nmore to providence and the main ocean, and proceeding the same way i\\r\\nwent the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\ni did not sail extraordinary fast, but frequently fished in proper\\r\\nplaces, and caught a great deal, salting and drying the best of what i\\r\\ntook. for three weeks\\' time and more, i saw no entrance into the island,\\r\\nas i call it, nor anything but the same unscalable rock. this uniform\\r\\nprospect gave me so little hopes of landing, that i was almost of a mind\\r\\nto have returned again. but, on mature deliberation, resolving to go\\r\\nforward a day or two more, i had not proceeded twenty-four hours, when,\\r\\njust as it was becoming dark, i heard a great noise, as of a fall of\\r\\nwater, whereupon i proposed to lie by and wait for day, to see what it\\r\\nwas; but the stream insensibly drawing me on, i soon found myself in an\\r\\neddy; and the boat drawing forward beyond all my power to resist it, i\\r\\nwas quickly sucked under a low arch, where, if i had not fallen flat in\\r\\nmy boat, having barely light enough to see my danger, i had undoubtedly\\r\\nbeen crushed to pieces or driven overboard. i could perceive the boat\\r\\nto fall with incredible violence, as i thought, down a precipice, and\\r\\nsuddenly whirled round and round with me, the water roaring on all\\r\\nsides, and dashing against the rock with a most amazing noise.\\r\\n\\r\\ni expected every moment my poor little vessel would be staved against\\r\\nthe rock, and i overwhelmed with waters; and for that reason never once\\r\\nattempted to rise up, or look upon my peril, till after the commotion\\r\\nhad in some measure ceased. at length, finding the perturbation of the\\r\\nwater abate, and as if by degrees i came into a smoother stream, i took\\r\\ncourage just to lift up my affrighted head; but guess, if you can, the\\r\\nhorror which seized me, on finding myself in the blackest of darkness,\\r\\nunable to perceive the smallest glimmer of light.\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever, as my boat seemed to glide easily, i roused myself and struck a\\r\\nlight; but if i had my terrors before, what must i have now! i was quite\\r\\nstupefied at the tremendous view of an immense arch over my head, to\\r\\nwhich i could see no bounds; the stream itself, as i judged, was about\\r\\nthirty yards broad, but in some places wider, in some narrower. it was\\r\\nwell for me i happened to have a tinder-box, or, though i had escaped\\r\\nhitherto, i must have at lust perished; for in the narrower parts of the\\r\\nstream, where it ran swiftest, there were frequently such crags stood\\r\\nout from the rock, by reason of the turnings and windings, and such\\r\\nsets of the current against them, as, could i not have seen to manage my\\r\\nboat, which i took great care to keep in the middle of the stream, must\\r\\nhave thrown me on them, to my inevitable destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nhappy it was for me, also, i was so well victualled, and that i had\\r\\ntaken with me two bottles of oil (as i supposed, for i did not imagine\\r\\ni had any more), or i had certainly been lost, not only through hunger,\\r\\nfor i was, to my guess, five weeks in the vault or cavern, but for\\r\\nwant of light, which the oil furnished, and without which all other\\r\\nconveniences could have been of no avail to me. i was forced to keep my\\r\\nlamp always burning; so, not knowing how long my residence was to be in\\r\\nthat place, or when i should get my discharge from it, if ever, i was\\r\\nobliged to husband my oil with the utmost frugality; and notwithstanding\\r\\nall my caution, it grew low, and was just spent, in little above half\\r\\nthe time i stayed there.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had now cut a piece of my shirt for a wick to my last drop of oil,\\r\\nwhich i twisted and lighted. i burnt the oil in my brass tobacco-box,\\r\\nwhich i had fitted pretty well to answer the purpose sitting down, i had\\r\\nmany black thoughts of what must follow the loss of my light, which i\\r\\nconsidered as near expiring, and that, i feared, for ever. i am here,\\r\\nthought i, like a poor condemned criminal, who knows his execution\\r\\nis fixed for such a day, nay, such an hour, and dies over and over in\\r\\nimagination, and by the torture of his mind, till that hour comes: that\\r\\nhour, which he so much dreads! and yet that very hour which releases him\\r\\nfrom all farther dread! thus do i--my last wick is kindled--my last drop\\r\\nof fuel is consuming!--and i am every moment apprehending the shocks of\\r\\nthe rock, the suffocation of the water; and, in short, thinking over my\\r\\ndying thoughts, till the snuff of my lamp throws up its last curling,\\r\\nexpiring flame, and then my quietus will be presently signed, and i\\r\\nreleased from my tormenting anxiety! happy minute! come then; i only\\r\\nwait for thee! my spirits grew so low and feeble upon this, that i had\\r\\nrecourse to my brandy bottle to raise them; but, as i was just going to\\r\\ntake a sip, i reflected that would only increase thirst, and, therefore,\\r\\nit were better to take a little of my white madeira; so, putting\\r\\nmy dram-bottle again into the chest, i held up one of madeira, as i\\r\\nfancied, to the lamp, and seeing it was white (for i had red too) i\\r\\nclapped it eagerly to my mouth, when the first gulp gave me a greater\\r\\nrefreshment, and more cheered my heart, than all the other liquors i had\\r\\nput together could have done; insomuch, as i had almost leaped over the\\r\\nboat\\'s side for joy. \"it is oil!\" cried i aloud, \"it is oil!\" i set it\\r\\ndown carefully, with inexpressible pleasure; and examining the rest of\\r\\nthe bottles i had taken for white madeira, i found two more of those\\r\\nto be filled with oil. \"now,\" says i, \"here is the counterpart of my\\r\\ncondemned prisoner! for let but a pardon come, though at the gallows,\\r\\nhow soon does he forget he has been an unhappy villain! and i, too, have\\r\\nscarce a notion now, how a man, in my case, could feel such sorrow as i\\r\\nhave for want of a little oil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nafter my first transport, i found myself grow serious, reflecting upon\\r\\nthe vigilance of providence over us poor creatures, and the various\\r\\ninstances wherein it interposes to save or relieve us in cases of\\r\\nthe deepest distress, where our own foresight, wisdom, and power have\\r\\nutterly failed, and when, looking all around, we could discover no\\r\\nmeans of deliverance. and i saw a train of circumstances leading to\\r\\nthe incident i have just mentioned, which obliged me to acknowledge the\\r\\nsuperintendence of heaven over even my affairs; and as the goodness\\r\\nof god had cared for me thus far, and manifested itself to me now, in\\r\\nrescuing me, as it were, from being swallowed up in darkness, i had\\r\\nground to hope he intended a complete deliverance of me out of\\r\\nthat dismal abyss, and would cause me yet to praise him in the full\\r\\nbrightness of day.\\r\\n\\r\\na series of these meditations brought me (at the end of five weeks, as\\r\\nnearly as i could compute it by my lamp) to a prodigious lake of water,\\r\\nbordered with a grassy down, about half a mile wide, of the finest\\r\\nverdure i had ever seen: this again was flanked with a wood or grove,\\r\\nrising like an amphitheatre, of about the same breadth; and behind, and\\r\\nabove all, appeared the naked rock to an immense height.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xi.\\r\\n\\r\\n     his joy on his arrival at land--a description of the place--\\r\\n     no inhabitants--wants fresh water--resides in a grotto--\\r\\n     finds water--views the country--carries his things to the\\r\\n     grotto.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is impossible to express my joy at the sight of day once more. i got\\r\\non the land as soon as possible after my dismission from the cavern,\\r\\nand, kneeling on the ground, returned hearty thanks to god for my\\r\\ndeliverance, begging, at the same time, grace to improve his mercies,\\r\\nand that i might continue under his protection, whatever should\\r\\nhereafter befall me, and at last die on my native soil.\\r\\n\\r\\ni unloaded my vessel as well as i could, and hauled her up on the\\r\\nshore; and, turning her upside down, made her a covering for my arms\\r\\nand baggage. i then sat down to contemplate the place, and eat a most\\r\\ndelightful meal on the grass, being quite a new thing to me.\\r\\n\\r\\ni walked over the greensward to the wood, with my gun in my hand, a\\r\\nbrace of pistols in my girdle, and my cutlass hanging before me; but,\\r\\nwhen i was just entering the wood, looking behind me and all around the\\r\\nplain, \"is it possible,\" says i, \"that so much art (for i did not then\\r\\nbelieve it was natural) could have been bestowed upon this place, and\\r\\nno inhabitant in it? here are neither buildings, huts, castle, nor any\\r\\nliving creature to be seen! it cannot be,\" says i, \"that this place was\\r\\nmade for nothing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\ni then went a considerable way into the wood, and inclined to have gone\\r\\nmuch farther, it being very beautiful, but, on second thoughts, judged\\r\\nit best to content myself at present with only looking out a safe\\r\\nretreat for that night; for, however agreeable the place then seemed,\\r\\ndarkness was at hand, when everything about me would have more or less\\r\\nof horror in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe wood, at its first entrance, was composed of the most charming\\r\\nflowering shrubs that can be imagined; each growing upon its own stem,\\r\\nat so convenient a distance from the other, that you might fairly pass\\r\\nbetween them any way without the least incommodity. behind them grew\\r\\nnumberless trees, somewhat taller, of the greatest variety of shapes,\\r\\nforms, and verdures the eye ever beheld; each, also, so far asunder as\\r\\nwas necessary for the spreading of their several branches and the growth\\r\\nof their delicious fruits, without a bush, briar, or shrub amongst them.\\r\\nbehind these, and still on the higher ground, grew an infinite number\\r\\nof very large, tall trees, much loftier than the former, but intermixed\\r\\nwith some underwood, which grew thicker and closer the nearer you\\r\\napproached the rock. i made a shift to force my way through these as far\\r\\nas the rock, which rose as perpendicular as a regular building, having\\r\\nonly here and there some crags and unevennesses. there was, i observed,\\r\\na space all the way between the underwood and the rock, wide enough\\r\\nto drive a cart in; and, indeed, i thought it had been left for that\\r\\npurpose.\\r\\n\\r\\ni walked along this passage a good way, having tied a rag of the lining\\r\\nof my jacket at the place of my entrance, to know it again at my coming\\r\\nback, which i intended to be ere it grew dark; but i found so much\\r\\npleasure in the walk, and surveying a small natural grotto which was in\\r\\nthe rock, that the daylight forsook me unawares: whereupon i resolved\\r\\nto put off my return unto the boat till next morning, and to take up my\\r\\nlodging for that night in the cave.\\r\\n\\r\\ni cut down a large bundle of underwood with my cutlass, sufficient to\\r\\nstop up the mouth of the grotto, and laying me down to rest, slept as\\r\\nsound as if i had been on board my ship; for i never had one hour\\'s rest\\r\\ntogether since i shot the gulf till this. nature, indeed, could not have\\r\\nsupported itself thus long under much labour; but as i had nothing to do\\r\\nbut only keep the middle stream, i began to be as used to guide myself\\r\\nin it with my eyes almost closed, and my senses retired, as a higgler is\\r\\nto drive his cart to market in his sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next morning i awaked sweetly refreshed; and, by the sign of my rag,\\r\\nfound the way again through the underwood to my boat i raised that up a\\r\\nlittle, took out some bread and cheese, and, having eat pretty heartily,\\r\\nlaid me down to drink at the lake, which looked as clear as crystal,\\r\\nexpecting a most delicious draught; but i had forgot it brought me\\r\\nfrom the sea, and my first gulp almost poisoned me. this was a sore\\r\\ndisappointment, for i knew my water-cask was nigh emptied; and, indeed,\\r\\nturning up my boat again, i drew out all that remained, and drank it,\\r\\nfor i was much athirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever, i did not despair; i was now so used to god\\'s providence, and\\r\\nhad a sense of its operations so riveted in my mind, that though the\\r\\nvast lake of salt water was surrounded by an impenetrable rock or\\r\\nbarrier of stone, i rested satisfied that i should rather find even that\\r\\nyield me a fresh and living stream, than that i should perish for want\\r\\nof it.\\r\\n\\r\\nwith this easy mind did i travel five or six miles on the side of the\\r\\nlake, and sometimes stepped into the wood, and walked a little there,\\r\\ntill i had gone almost half the diameter of the lake, which lay in a\\r\\ncircular or rather an oval figure. i had then thoughts of walking back,\\r\\nto be near my boat and lodging, for fear i should be again benighted\\r\\nif i went much farther; but, considering i had come past no water, and\\r\\npossibly i might yet find some if i went quite round the lake, i rather\\r\\nchose to take up with a new lodging that night, than to return; and i\\r\\ndid not want for a supper, having brought out with me more bread and\\r\\ncheese than had served for dinner, the remainder of which was in the\\r\\nlining of my jacket. when it grew darkish, i had some thoughts of\\r\\neating; but i considered, as i was then neither very hungry nor dry, if\\r\\ni should eat it would but occasion drought, and i had nothing to\\r\\nallay that with; so i contented myself for that night to lay me down\\r\\nsupperless.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the morning i set forward again upon my water search, and hoped to\\r\\ncompass the whole lake that day. i had gone about seven miles more,\\r\\nwhen, at a little distance before me, i perceived a small hollow or cut\\r\\nin the grass from the wood to the lake; thither i hasted with all speed,\\r\\nand blessed god for the supply of a fine fresh rill, which, distilling\\r\\nfrom several small clefts in the rock, had collected itself into one\\r\\nstream, and cut its way through the green sod to the lake.\\r\\n\\r\\ni lay down with infinite pleasure, and swallowed a most cheering draught\\r\\nof the precious liquid; and, sitting on the brink, made a good meal of\\r\\nwhat i had with me, and then drank again. i had now got five-sixths of\\r\\nthe lake\\'s circumference to go back again to my boat, for i did not\\r\\nsuspect any passage over the cavern\\'s mouth where i came into the lake;\\r\\nand i could not, without much trouble, consider that, if i would have\\r\\nthis water for a constant supply, i must either come a long way for it,\\r\\nor fix my habitation near it. i was just going back again, revolving\\r\\nthese uneasy thoughts in my breast, when this rose suddenly in my mind,\\r\\nthat, if i could possibly get over the mouth of the cavern, i should not\\r\\nhave above three miles from my grotto to the water. now, as i could not\\r\\nget home that night otherwise than by crossing it, and as, if i lost my\\r\\nlabour, i should be but where i was, whereas if i should get over it, it\\r\\nwould very much shorten my journey, i resolved to try whether the\\r\\nthing was practicable, first, however, looking out for a resting-place\\r\\nsomewhere near my water, if i should meet with a disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\ni then walked into the wood, where, meeting with no place of retreat to\\r\\nmy liking, i went to my rill, and taking another sup, determined not to\\r\\nleave that side of the lake till morning; but having some time to\\r\\nspare, i walked about two miles to view the inlet of the lake, and was\\r\\nagreeably surprised, just over the mouth of the cavern, to see a large\\r\\nstone arch like a bridge, as if it had been cut out of the rock, quite\\r\\nacross the opening: this cheered me vastly, and, pushing over it, i\\r\\nfound a path that brought me to my boat before night.\\r\\n\\r\\ni then went up to my grotto for the third night in this most delightful\\r\\nplace; and the next morning early i launched my boat, and taking my\\r\\nwater-cask and a small dipping bucket with me, i rowed away for the\\r\\nrill, and returned highly pleased with a sufficiency of water, whereof\\r\\ni carried a bucket and a copper kettle full up with me to the grotto.\\r\\nindeed, it was not the least part of my satisfaction that i had this\\r\\nkettle with me; for though i was in hopes, in my last voyage, i should\\r\\nhave come to some shore, where i could have landed and enjoyed myself\\r\\nover some of my fish, and for that reason had taken it, notwithstanding\\r\\nthings did not turn out just as i had schemed, yet my kettle proved the\\r\\nmost useful piece of furniture i had.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving now acquainted myself with the circumference of the lake, and\\r\\nsettled a communication with my rill, i began to think of commencing\\r\\nhousekeeper. in order thereunto, i set about removing my goods up to the\\r\\ngrotto. by constant application, in a few days i had gotten all thither\\r\\nbut my two great chests and my water-cask; and how to drag or drive\\r\\nany of those to it, i was entirely at a loss. my water-cask was of the\\r\\nutmost importance to me, and i had thoughts sometimes of stopping it\\r\\nclose, and rolling it to the place; but the ascent through the wood to\\r\\nthe grotto was so steep, that, besides the fear of staving it,\\r\\nwhich would have been an irreparable loss, i judged it impossible to\\r\\naccomplish it by my strength; so with a good deal of discontent, i\\r\\ndetermined to remit both that and the chests to future consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xii.\\r\\n\\r\\n     an account of the grotto--a room added to it---a view of\\r\\n     that building--the author makes a little cart--also a wet\\r\\n     dock for his boat--goes in quest of provision--a description\\r\\n     of divers fruits and plants--he brings home a cart-load of\\r\\n     different sorts--makes experiments on them--loads his cart\\r\\n     with others--a great disappointment--makes good bread--never\\r\\n     sees the sun--the nature of the light\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving come to a full resolution of fixing my residence at the\\r\\ngrotto, and making that my capital seat, it is proper to give you some\\r\\ndescription of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis grotto, then, was a full mile from the lake, in the rock which\\r\\nencompassed the wood. the entrance was scarcely two feet wide, and about\\r\\nnine feet high, rising from the height of seven feet upward to a point\\r\\nin the middle. the cavity was about fifteen feet long within, and about\\r\\nfive wide. being obliged to lie lengthwise in it, full six feet of it\\r\\nwere taken up at the farther end for my lodging only, as nothing could\\r\\nstand on the side of my bed that would leave me room to come at it. the\\r\\nremaining nine feet of the cave\\'s length were taken up, first, by my\\r\\nfireplace, which was the deepest side of the doorway, ranging with my\\r\\nbed (which i had set close to the rock on one side), and took up near\\r\\nthree feet in length; and my furniture and provisions, of one sort or\\r\\nother, so filled up the rest, that i had much ado to creep between them\\r\\ninto my bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the chest which i had taken for a seat in the boat, as aforesaid,\\r\\nupon breaking it open by the water-side, i found a mattress, some\\r\\nshirts, shoes, stockings, and several other useful things; a small case\\r\\nof bottles with cordials in them, some instruments of surgery, plasters\\r\\nand salves; all which, together with a large quantity of fish that i had\\r\\nsalted, i carried to the grotto.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy habitation being thus already overcharged, and as i could not,\\r\\nhowever, bear the thoughts of quitting it, or of having any of my\\r\\ngoods exposed to the weather on the outside, i was naturally bent on\\r\\ncontriving how i should increase my accommodations. as i had no prospect\\r\\nof enlarging the grotto itself, i could conceive no other way of\\r\\neffecting my desire but by the addition of an outer room. this thought\\r\\npleased me very much, so that the next day i set myself to plan out the\\r\\nbuilding, and trace the foundation of it.\\r\\n\\r\\ni told you before there was about the space of a cart-way between the\\r\\nwood and the rock clear; but this breadth, as i was building for\\r\\nlife (so i imagined), not appearing to me spacious enough for my new\\r\\napartment, i considered how i should extend its bounds into the wood.\\r\\nhereupon i set myself to observe what trees stood at a proper distance\\r\\nfrom my grotto, that might serve as they stood, with a little management\\r\\nof hewing and the like, to compose a noble doorway, posts, and\\r\\nsupporters; and i found, that upon cutting down three of the nearest\\r\\ntrees, i should answer my purpose in this respect; and there were\\r\\nseveral others, about twenty feet from the grotto, and running parallel\\r\\nwith the rock, the situation of which was so happily adapted to my\\r\\nintention, that i could make them become, as i fancied, an out-fence or\\r\\nwall; so i took my axe and cut down my nearest trees, but as i was\\r\\ngoing to strike, a somewhat different scheme presented itself to my\\r\\nimagination that altered my resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nin conformity with this new plan, i fixed the height of my intended\\r\\nceiling, and sawed off my nearest trees to that, sloping from the sides\\r\\nto the middle, to support cross-beams for the roof to rest on, and left\\r\\nthe trunks standing, by way of pillars, both for the use and ornament of\\r\\nthe structure. in short, i worked hard every day upon my building for a\\r\\nmonth, in which time i had cut all my timber into their proper lengths\\r\\nfor my outworks and covering, but was at a great stand how to fix my\\r\\nside-posts, having no spade or mattock, and the ground almost as hard\\r\\nas flint, for to be sure it had never been stirred since the creation. i\\r\\nthen thought i had the worst part of my job to get over; however, i went\\r\\non, and having contrived, in most of my upright side-quarters, to take\\r\\nthe tops of trees, and leave on the lower parts their cleft, where they\\r\\nbegan to branch out and divide from the main stem, i set one of them\\r\\nupright against the rock, then laid one end of my long ceiling-pieces\\r\\nupon the cleft of it, and laid the other end upon a tree on the same\\r\\nside, whose top i had also sawed off with a proper cleft i then went and\\r\\ndid the same on the other side; after this i laid on a proper number of\\r\\ncross-beams, and tied all very firmly together with the bark of young\\r\\ntrees stripped off in long thongs, which answered that purpose very\\r\\nwell. thus i proceeded, crossing, joining, and fastening all together,\\r\\ntill the whole roof was so strong and firm that there was no stirring\\r\\nany part of it i then spread it over with small lop wood, on which i\\r\\nraised a ridge of dried grass and weeds, very thick, and thatched over\\r\\nthe whole with the leaves of a tree very much resembling those of a\\r\\npalm, but much thicker, and not quite so broad; the entire surface, i\\r\\nmight say, was as smooth as a die, and so ordered, by a gentle declivity\\r\\nevery way, as to carry off the wet.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving covered in my building, i was next to finish and close the\\r\\nwalls of it; the skeleton of these was composed of sticks, crossing one\\r\\nanother checker-wise and tied together; to fill up the voids, i wove\\r\\nupon them the longest and most pliable twigs of the underwood i could\\r\\nfind, leaving only a doorway on one side, between two stems of a tree\\r\\nwhich, dividing in the trunk at about two feet from the ground, grew\\r\\nfrom thence, for the rest of its height, as if the branches were a\\r\\ncouple of trees a little distance from one another, which made a sort of\\r\\nstile-way to my room. when this was all done, i tempered up some earth\\r\\nby the lake-side, and mixing it to a due consistence with mud, which i\\r\\ntook from the lake, applied it as a plastering in this manner: i divided\\r\\nit into pieces, which i rolled up of the size of a foot-ball; these\\r\\nlumps i stuck close by one another on the lattice, pressing them very\\r\\nhard with my hands, which forced part of them quite through the small\\r\\ntwigs, and then i smoothed both sides with the back of my saw, to about\\r\\nthe thickness of five or six inches; so that by this means i had a wall\\r\\nround my new apartment a foot thick. this plaster-work cost me some time\\r\\nand a great deal of labour, as i had a full mile to go to the lake\\r\\nfor every load of stuff, and could carry but little at once, it was so\\r\\nheavy; but there was neither water for tempering, nor proper earth to\\r\\nmake it with any nearer. at last, however, i completed my building in\\r\\nevery respect but a door, and for this i was forced to use the lid of my\\r\\nsea chest; which indeed i would have chosen not to apply that way, but\\r\\ni had nothing else that would, do; and there was, however, this\\r\\nconveniency, that it had hinges ready fixed thereon.\\r\\n\\r\\ni now began to enjoy myself in my new habitation, like the absolute and\\r\\nsole lord of the country, for i had neither seen man nor beast since my\\r\\narrival, save a few animals in the trees like our squirrels, and some\\r\\nwater-rats about the lake; but there were several strange kinds of birds\\r\\ni had never before seen, both on the lake and in the woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nthat which now troubled me most was how to get my water nearer to me\\r\\nthan the lake, for i had no lesser vessel than the cask, which held\\r\\nabove twenty gallons, and to bring that up was a fatigue intolerable.\\r\\nmy next contrivance, therefore, was this: i told you i had taken my\\r\\nchest-lid to make a door for my ante-chamber, as i now began to call it;\\r\\nso i resolved to apply the body of the chest also to a purpose different\\r\\nfrom that it originally answered. in order to this, i went to the lake\\r\\nwhere the body of the chest lay, and sawed it through within about three\\r\\ninches of the bottom. of the two ends, having rounded them as well as i\\r\\ncould, i made two wheels; and with one of the sides i made two more. i\\r\\nburnt a hole through the middle of each; then preparing two axle-trees,\\r\\ni fastened them, after putting on the wheels, to the bottom of the chest\\r\\nwith the nails i had drawn out, of it. having finished this machine, on\\r\\nwhich i bestowed no small labour, i was hugely pleased with it, and only\\r\\nwished i had a beast, if it were but an ass, to draw it; however, that\\r\\ntask i was satisfied to perform myself, since there was no help for it;\\r\\nso i made a good strong cord out of my fishing-lines, and fixed that\\r\\nto drag it by. when all was thus in readiness, filling my water-cask,\\r\\ni bound it thereon, and so brought it to the grotto with such ease,\\r\\ncomparatively, as quite charmed me. having succeeded so well in the\\r\\nfirst essay, i no sooner unloaded but down went i again with my cart,\\r\\nor truckle rather, to the lake, and brought from thence on it my other\\r\\nchest, which i had left entire.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had now nothing remaining near the lake but my boat, and had half a\\r\\nmind to try to bring that up too; but having so frequent occasion for\\r\\nher to get my water in, which i used in greater abundance now than i had\\r\\ndone at first, a great part going to supply my domestic uses, as well as\\r\\nfor drinking, i resolved against that, and sought out for a convenient\\r\\ndock to stow it in as a preservative against wind and weather, which i\\r\\nsoon after effected; for having pitched upon a swampy place, overgrown\\r\\nwith a sort of long flags or reeds, i soon cut a trench from the lake,\\r\\nwith a sort of spade or board that i had chopped and sharpened for that\\r\\nuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus having stowed my boat and looked over all my goods and sorted them,\\r\\nand taken a survey of my provisions, i found i must soon be in want\\r\\nof the last if i did not forthwith procure a supply; for though i had\\r\\nvictualled so well at setting out, and had been very sparing ever since,\\r\\nyet had it not been for a great quantity of fish i took and salted in my\\r\\npassage to the gulf, i had been to seek for food much sooner. hereupon i\\r\\nthought it highly prudent to look out before i really wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nwith this resolution i accoutred myself, as in my first walk, with my\\r\\ninstruments and arms; but instead of travelling the lake-side, i went\\r\\nalong the wood, and therein found great plenty of divers kinds of fruits\\r\\n\\\\ though i could scarce persuade myself to taste or try the effects\\r\\nof them, being so much unlike our own, or any i had seen elsewhere. i\\r\\nobserved amongst the shrubs abundance of a fruit, or whatever else you\\r\\nmay call it, which grew like a ram\\'s-horn; sharp at the point next the\\r\\ntwig it was fastened to, and circling round and round, one fold upon\\r\\nanother, which gradually increased to the size of my wrist in the\\r\\nmiddle, and then as gradually decreased till it terminated in a point\\r\\nagain at the contrary extreme; all which spiral, if it were fairly\\r\\nextended in length, might be a yard or an ell long. i surveyed this\\r\\nstrange vegetable very attentively; it had a rind, or crust, which i\\r\\ncould not break with my hand, but taking my knife and making an opening\\r\\ntherewith in the shell, there issued out a sort of milky liquor in great\\r\\nquantity, to at least a pint and half, which having tasted, i found as\\r\\nsweet as honey, and very pleasant: however, i could not persuade myself\\r\\nany more than just to taste it. i then found on the large trees several\\r\\nkinds of fruit, like pears or quinces, but most of them exceeding hard\\r\\nand rough, and quite disagreeable; so i quitted my hopes of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nabout three miles from my grotto i met with a large space of ground full\\r\\nof a low plant, growing only with a single woody stalk half a foot\\r\\nhigh, and from thence issued a round head, about a foot or ten inches\\r\\ndiameter, but quite flat, about three-quarters of an inch thick, and\\r\\njust like a cream-cheese standing upon its edge: these grew so close\\r\\ntogether, that upon the least wind stirring, their heads rattled against\\r\\neach other very musically; for though the stalks were so very strong\\r\\nthat they would not easily either bend or break, yet the fanning of the\\r\\nwind upon the broad heads twisting the stalks, so as to let the heads\\r\\nstrike each other, they made a most agreeable sound.\\r\\n\\r\\ni stood some time admiring this shrub, and then cutting up one of them,\\r\\ni found it weighed about two pounds; they had a tough green rind or\\r\\ncovering, very smooth, and the inside full of a stringy pulp, quite\\r\\nwhite. in short, i made divers other trials of berries, roots, herbs,\\r\\nand what else i could find, but received little satisfaction from any\\r\\nof them for fear of bad qualities. i returned back ruminating on what\\r\\nthings i had seen, resolving to take my cart the next walk, and bring\\r\\nit home loaded with different kinds of them, in order to make my trials\\r\\nthereof at leisure: but my cart being too flat and wanting sides, i\\r\\nconsidered it would carry very little, and that what it would otherwise\\r\\nbear, on that account, must tumble and roll off, so i made a fire and\\r\\nturned smith; for with a great deal to do breaking off the wards of a\\r\\nlarge key i had, and making it red-hot, i by degrees fashioned it into a\\r\\nkind of spindle, and therewith making holes quite round the bottom of my\\r\\ncart, in them i stuck up sticks about two feet high that i had tapered\\r\\nat the end to fit them.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving thus qualified my cart for a load, i proceeded with it to the\\r\\nwood, and cutting a small quantity of each species of green, berry,\\r\\nfruit, and flower that i could find, and packing them severally in\\r\\nparcels, i returned at night heavy-laden, and held a council with myself\\r\\nwhat use they could most properly be applied to.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had amongst my goods, as i said, a copper-kettle which held about a\\r\\ngallon: this i set over my fire and boiled something by turns of every\\r\\nsort in it, watching all the while, and with a stick stirring and\\r\\nraising up one thing and then another, to feel when they were boiled\\r\\ntender: but of upwards of twenty greens which i thus dressed, only one\\r\\nproved eatable, all the rest becoming more stringy, tough, and\\r\\ninsipid for the cooking. the one i have excepted was a round, thick,\\r\\nwoolly-leafed plant, which boiled tender and tasted as well as spinach;\\r\\ni therefore preserved some leaves of this to know it again by; and for\\r\\ndistinction called it by the name of that herb.\\r\\n\\r\\ni then began upon my fruits of the pear and quince kind, at least eight\\r\\ndifferent sorts; but i found i could make nothing of them, for they were\\r\\nmost of them as rough and crabbed after stewing as before, so i laid\\r\\nthem all aside. lastly, i boiled my ram\\'s-horn and cream-cheese, as i\\r\\ncalled them, together. upon tasting the latter of these, it was become\\r\\nso watery and insipid, i laid it aside as useless. i then cut the other\\r\\nand tasted the juice, which proved so exceeding pleasant that i took a\\r\\nlarge gulp or two of it, and tossed it into the kettle again.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving now gone through the several kinds of my exotics, i had a mind\\r\\nto re-examine them after cooling, but could make nothing of any of my\\r\\ngreens but the spinach. i tried several berries and nuts too, but, save\\r\\na few sort of nuts, they were all very tasteless. then i began to review\\r\\nthe fruits, and could find but two sorts that i had any the least hopes\\r\\nfrom. i then laid the best by and threw the others away. after this\\r\\nprocess, which took me up near a whole day, and clearing my house of\\r\\ngood-for-nothings, i returned to reexamine my cheese, that was grown\\r\\ncold, and was now so dry and hard i could not get my teeth into it; upon\\r\\nwhich i was going to skim it away out of my grotto, saying, \"go, thou\\r\\nworthless!\" (for i always spoke aloud my thoughts to myself)--i say i\\r\\nwas just despatching it when i checked my hands, and as i could make\\r\\nno impression with my teeth, had a mind to try what my knife would do.\\r\\naccordingly i began at the edge of the quarter, for i had boiled but a\\r\\nquarter of it, but the rind was grown so hard and brittle that my knife\\r\\nslipping and raking along the cut edge of it, scratched off some powder\\r\\nas white as possible; i then scraped it backward and forward some time,\\r\\ntill i found it would all scrape away in this powder, except the rind,\\r\\nupon which i laid it aside again for farther experiment.\\r\\n\\r\\nduring this review my kettle and ram\\'s-horn had been boiling, till\\r\\nhearing it blubber very loud, and seeing there was but little liquor in\\r\\nit, i whipped it off the fire, for fear of burning its bottom, but took\\r\\nno further notice of it till about two hours after; when returning\\r\\nto the grotto, i went to wash out my kettle, but could scarce get my\\r\\nram\\'s-horn from the bottom; and when i did, it brought up with it a\\r\\nsort of pitchy substance, though not so black, and several gummy threads\\r\\nhanging to it, drawn out to a great length. i wondered at this, and\\r\\nthought the shell of the ram\\'s-horn had melted, or some such thing,\\r\\ntill, venturing to put a little of the stuff on my tongue, it proved to\\r\\nmy thinking as good treacle as i had ever tasted.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis new discovery pleased me very much. i scraped all the sweet thing\\r\\nup, and laid it near my grotto in a large leaf of one of the trees\\r\\n(about two feet long, and broad in proportion) to prevent its running\\r\\nabout. in getting this curiosity out of my kettle, i found in it a small\\r\\npiece of my cheese, which i suppose had been broke off in stirring; and\\r\\nbiting it (for it was soft enough) i think it was the most luscious and\\r\\ndelicate morsel i ever put into my lips. this unexpected good fortune\\r\\nput me on trying the best of my pears again; so setting on my kettle,\\r\\nwith very little water, and putting some of my treacle into it, and two\\r\\nof the best pears quartered, i found, upon a little boiling, they also\\r\\nbecame an excellent dainty.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving succeeded so well, i was quite ripe for another journey with\\r\\nmy cart; which i accordingly undertook, taking my route over the stone\\r\\nbridge, to see what the other side of the lake produced. in travelling\\r\\nthrough the trees, i met, amongst other things, with abundance of large\\r\\ngourds, which, climbing the trees, displayed their fruit to the height\\r\\nof twenty or thirty feet above the ground. i cut a great many of\\r\\nthese, and some very large ones of different hues and forms; which of\\r\\nthemselves making a great load, with some few new sorts of berries and\\r\\ngreens, were the gathering of that day. but i must tell you i was almost\\r\\nfoiled in getting them home; for coming to my stone bridge, it rose so\\r\\nsteep, and was so much ruggeder than the grass or wood ground, that i\\r\\nwas at a set upon the first entrance and terribly afraid that i should\\r\\neither break my wheels or pull off my axle-trees. hereupon i was forced\\r\\nto unload, and carry my cargo over in my arms to the other side of the\\r\\nbridge; whither having then, with less fear but much caution, drawn my\\r\\ncart, i loaded again and got safe home.\\r\\n\\r\\ni was mightily pleased with the acquisitions of this journey; for now,\\r\\nthought i, i shall have several convenient family utensils; so spent the\\r\\nnext day or two in scooping my gourds and cleaning away the pulp. when i\\r\\nhad done this, finding the rinds to be very weak and yielding, i made\\r\\na good fire, and setting them round it at a moderate distance to dry,\\r\\ni went about something else without doors: but, alas! my hopes were ill\\r\\nfounded; for coming home to turn my gourds and see how dry they were, i\\r\\nfound them all warped and turned into a variety of uncouth shapes. this\\r\\nput me to a stand; but, however, i recovered some pieces of them for\\r\\nuse, as the bottom parts of most of them, after paring away the sides,\\r\\nwould hold something, though they by no means answered my first purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nwell, thought i, what if i have lost my gourds, i have gained\\r\\nexperience. i will dry them next time with the guts in, and having\\r\\nstiffened their rinds in their proper dimensions, then try to cleanse\\r\\nthem. so next morning (for i was very eager at it) i set out with my\\r\\ncart for another load; and having handed them over the bridge, got safe\\r\\nwith them to the grotto. these by proper management proved exceedingly\\r\\nvaluable to me, answering, in one way or other, the several uses of\\r\\nplates, bottles, pans, and divers other vessels.\\r\\n\\r\\ni now got a large quantity of the vegetable ram\\'s-horn, and filled a\\r\\ngreat many of the gourds with the treacle it yielded; i also boiled and\\r\\ndried a large parcel of my cheeses, and hung them up for use, for i had\\r\\nnow for some time made all my bread of the latter, scraping and bruising\\r\\nthe flour, and mixing it with my treacle and water; and this indeed made\\r\\nsuch a sweet and nourishing bread, that i could even have lived wholly\\r\\nupon it; but i afterwards very much improved it by putting the milky\\r\\njuice of the ram\\'s-horn, unboiled, to my flour in a small quantity, and\\r\\nthen baking it on the hearth, covered over with embers. this detracted\\r\\nnothing from the sweetness and mellowness of my bread, but made it much\\r\\nlighter than the treacle alone would have done.\\r\\n\\r\\nfinding there was no fear of starving, but so far from it, that from\\r\\nday to day i found out something new to add to my repast, either in\\r\\nsubstantials or by way of dessert, i set me down very well contented\\r\\nwith my condition. i had nothing to do but to lay up store against\\r\\nsickness and the dark weather, which last i expected would soon be upon\\r\\nme, as the days were now exceeding short. indeed, though i had now been\\r\\nhere six months, i had never seen the sun since i first entered the\\r\\ngulf; and though there was very little rain, and but few clouds, yet the\\r\\nbrightest daylight never exceeded that of half an hour after sunset in\\r\\nthe summer-time in england, and little more than just reddened the\\r\\nsky. for the first part of my time here, there was but little if any\\r\\ndifference between day and night; but afterwards, what i might call the\\r\\nnight, or lesser degree of light, took up more hours than the greater,\\r\\nand went on gradually increasing as to time, so that i perceived total\\r\\ndarkness approached, such as i had on board my ship the year before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xiii.\\r\\n\\r\\n     the author lays in a store against the dark weather-hears\\r\\n     voices--his thoughts thereon--persuades himself it was a\\r\\n     dream--hears them again--determines to see if any one lodged\\r\\n     in the rock--is satisfied there is nobody--observations on\\r\\n     what he saw--finds a strong weed like whipcord--makes a\\r\\n     drag-net--lengthens it--catches a monster--its description--\\r\\n     makes oil of it\\r\\n\\r\\ni had now well stored my grotto with all sorts of winter provisions, and\\r\\nfeeling the weather grow very cold, i expected and waited patiently for\\r\\nthe total darkness. i went little abroad, and employed myself within\\r\\ndoors endeavouring to fence against the approaching extremity of the\\r\\ncold. for this purpose i prepared a quantity of rushes, which being\\r\\nvery dry, i spread them smoothly on the floor of my bed-chamber a good\\r\\nthickness, and over them i laid my mattress. then i made a double sheet\\r\\nof the boat\\'s awning or sail, that i had brought to cover my goods; and\\r\\nhaving skewered together several of the jackets and clothes i found in\\r\\nthe chest, of them i made a coverlid; so that i lay very commodiously,\\r\\nand made very long nights of it now the dark season was set in.\\r\\n\\r\\nas i lay awake one night, or day, i know not which, i very plainly heard\\r\\nthe sound of several human voices, and sometimes very loud; but though\\r\\ni could easily distinguish the articulations, i could not understand the\\r\\nleast word that was said; nor did the voices seem at all to me like such\\r\\nas i had anywhere heard before, but much softer and more musical. this\\r\\nstartled me, and i rose immediately, slipping on my clothes and taking\\r\\nmy gun in my hand (which i always kept charged, being my constant\\r\\ntravelling companion) and my cutlass. thus equipped, i walked into my\\r\\nante-chamber, where i heard the voices much plainer, till after some\\r\\nlittle time they by degrees died quite away. after watching here, and\\r\\nhearkening a good while, hearing nothing, i walked back into the grotto,\\r\\nand laid me down again on my bed. i was inclined to open the door of my\\r\\nante-chamber, but i own i was afraid; besides, i considered that if i\\r\\ndid, i could discover nothing at any distance by reason of the thick and\\r\\ngloomy wood that enclosed me.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had a thousand different surmises about the meaning of this odd\\r\\nincident; and could not conceive how any human creatures should be in\\r\\nmy kingdom (as i called it) but myself, and i never yet see them, or any\\r\\ntrace of their habitation. but then again i reflected, that though i had\\r\\nsurrounded the whole lake, yet i had not traced the out-bounds of the\\r\\nwood next the rock, where there might be innumerable grottoes like mine;\\r\\nnay, perhaps some as spacious as that i had sailed through to the lake;\\r\\nand that though i had not perceived it, yet this beautiful spot might be\\r\\nvery well peopled. but, says i again, if there be any such beings as\\r\\ni am fancying here, surely they don\\'t skulk in their dens, like savage\\r\\nbeasts, by daylight, and only patrole for prey by night; if so, i shall\\r\\nprobably become a delicious morsel for them ere long, if they meet with\\r\\nme. this kept me still more within doors than before, and i hardly ever\\r\\nstirred out but for water or firing. at length, hearing no more voices,\\r\\nnor seeing any one, i began to be more composed in my mind, and at last\\r\\ngrew persuaded it was all a mere delusion, and only a fancy of mine,\\r\\nwithout any real foundation; and sometimes, though i was sure i was\\r\\nfully awake when i heard them, i persuaded myself i had rose in my\\r\\nsleep, upon a dream of voices, and recollected with myself the various\\r\\nstories i had heard when a boy of walking in one\\'s sleep, and the\\r\\nsurprising effects of it; so the whole notion was now blown over.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had not enjoyed my tranquillity above a week, before my fears were\\r\\nroused afresh, hearing the same sound of voices twice the same night,\\r\\nbut not many minutes at a time. what gave me most pain was that they\\r\\nwere at such a distance, as i judged by the languor of the sound, that\\r\\nif i had opened my door i could not have seen the utterers through the\\r\\ntrees, and i was resolved not to venture out; but then i determined, if\\r\\nthey should come again anything near my grotto, to open the door, see\\r\\nwho they were, and stand upon my defence, whatever came of it: for, says\\r\\ni, my entrance is so narrow and high that more than one cannot come at a\\r\\ntime; and i can with ease despatch twenty of them before they can\\r\\nsecure me, if they should be savages; but if they prove sensible human\\r\\ncreatures, it will be a great benefit to me to join myself to their\\r\\nsociety. thus had i formed my scheme, but i heard no more of them for a\\r\\ngreat while; so that at length beginning to grow ashamed of my fears, i\\r\\nbecame tranquil again.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe day now returning, and with it my labours, i applied to my usual\\r\\ncallings; but my mind ran strangely upon viewing the rock quite round,\\r\\nthat is, the whole circuit of my dominions; for, thinks i, there may\\r\\npossibly be an outlet through the rock into some other country, from\\r\\nwhence the persons i heard may come. as soon therefore as the days grew\\r\\ntowards the longest, i prepared for my progress. having lived so well at\\r\\nhome since my settlement, i did not care to trust only to what i could\\r\\npick up in the woods for my subsistence during this journey, which would\\r\\nnot only take up time in procuring, but perhaps not agree with me; so\\r\\ni resolved to carry a supply with me, proportionate to the length of my\\r\\nperambulation. hereupon considering that though my walk round the lake\\r\\nwas finished in two days, yet as i now intended to go round by the rock,\\r\\nthe way would be much longer and perhaps more troublesome than that was;\\r\\nremembering also my journey with glanlepze in africa, and how much\\r\\ni complained of the fruits we carried for our subsistence; these\\r\\ncircumstances, i say, laying together, i resolved to load the cart with\\r\\na variety of food, bread and fruits especially, and draw that with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus provided, i sallied forth with great cheerfulness, and proceeded in\\r\\nthe main easily; though in some places i was forced to make way with\\r\\nmy hatchet, the ground was so over-run with underwood. i very narrowly\\r\\nviewed the rock as i went, bottom and sides, all the way, but could see\\r\\nnothing like a passage through it, or indeed any more than one opening,\\r\\nor inlet, which i entered for about thirty yards, but it was not above\\r\\nthree feet wide, and terminated in the solid rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter some days\\' travel (making all the observations i could on the\\r\\nseveral plants, shrubs, and trees which i met with, particularly where\\r\\nany of these occurred to me entirely new), finding myself a little\\r\\nfaintish, i had a mind for a sup of ram\\'s-horn juice; so i cut me one,\\r\\nbut upon opening it found therein only a pithy pulp, and noways fit to\\r\\ntaste. i supposed by this i was too early for the milk, it being three\\r\\nmonths later the last year when i cut them. hereon, seeing one upon\\r\\nanother shrub, which by its rusty colour i judged might have hung all\\r\\nthe winter, i opened that, and found it full of milk; but putting some\\r\\nof it into my mouth, it was as sour as any vinegar i ever tasted in my\\r\\nlife. so, thinks i (and said so too; for, as i told you before, i always\\r\\nspoke out), here\\'s sauce for something when i want it; and this gave\\r\\nme a hint to store myself with these gourds, to hang by for vinegar the\\r\\nnext winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nby this time i had come almost to my rill, when i entered upon a large\\r\\nplat of ground miserably over-run with weeds, matted together very\\r\\nthick. these choked up my wheels in such a manner that i could neither\\r\\nfree them with my hands, nor get either backwards or forwards, they\\r\\nbinding my cart down like so many cords; so that i was obliged to cut my\\r\\nway back again with my hatchet, and take a sweep round in the wood, on\\r\\nthe outside of these weeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nin all my life i never saw anything of its size, for it was no thicker\\r\\nthan a whipcord, so strong as this weed; and what raised my wonder was\\r\\nthe length of it, for i drew out pieces of it near fifty feet long, and\\r\\neven they were broken at the end, so that it might be as long again for\\r\\naught i know, for it was so matted and twisted together, that it was a\\r\\ngreat trial of patience to untangle it; but that which was driest,\\r\\nand to me looked the rottenest and weakest, i found to be much the\\r\\nstrongest. upon examination of its parts, i discovered it to be\\r\\ncomposed of an infinite number of small threads, spirally overlaying and\\r\\nenfolding one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nas i saw but few things that i could not find a use for, so this i\\r\\nperceived would serve all the common purposes of packthread; a thing i\\r\\nwas often in want of. this inclined me to take a load of it home with\\r\\nme. indeed the difficulty of getting a quantity in the condition i\\r\\ndesired it, puzzled me a little; for, says i, if i cut up a good deal\\r\\nof it with my hatchet, as i first designed, i shall only have small\\r\\nlengths, good for little, and to get it in pieces of any considerable\\r\\nlength, so as to be of service, will require much time and labour. but\\r\\nreflecting how much i needed it, and of what benefit it would be,\\r\\ni resolved to make a trial of what i could do; so, without more\\r\\nhesitation, i went to work, and cutting a fibre close to its root,\\r\\ni extricated that thread from all its windings, just as one does an\\r\\nentangled whipcord. when i had thus disengaged a sufficient length, i\\r\\ncut that off, and repeating the like operation, in about three hours\\'\\r\\ntime, but with no little toil, i made up my load of different lengths\\r\\njust to my liking. having finished this task, i filled the gourd,\\r\\nbrought for that purpose, with water; and having first viewed the whole\\r\\nremaining part of the rock, i returned over the stone bridge home again.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis journey, though it took me up several days, and was attended\\r\\nwith some fatigue, had yet given me great satisfaction; for now i\\r\\nwas persuaded i could not have one rival or enemy to fear in my whole\\r\\ndominions. and from the impossibility, as i supposed, of there being\\r\\nany, or of the ingress of any, unless by the same passage i entered\\r\\nat, and by which i was well assured they could never return, i grew\\r\\ncontented, and blamed myself for the folly of my imaginary voices, as i\\r\\ncalled them then, and took it for a distemper of the fancy only.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next day i looked over my load of matweed, having given it that\\r\\nname, and separated the different lengths from each other. i then found\\r\\ni had several pieces between forty and fifty feet long, of which i\\r\\nresolved to get a good number more, to make me a drag-net that i might\\r\\ntry for some fish in the lake. a day or two after, therefore, i brought\\r\\nhome another load of it then i picked out a smooth level spot upon the\\r\\ngreen-sward, and having prepared a great number of short wooden pegs, i\\r\\nstrained a line of the matweed about ten feet long, tying it at each end\\r\\nto a peg, and stuck a row of pegs along by that line, about two inches\\r\\nasunder; i next strained another line of the same length, parallel to\\r\\nthat, at the distance of forty feet from it, and stuck pegs thereby,\\r\\ncorresponding to the former row; and from each peg on one side, to the\\r\\nopposite peg on the other, i tied a like length of my mat-line, quite\\r\\nthrough the whole number of pegs; when the work looked like the inside\\r\\nof a harpsichord. i afterwards drove pegs in like manner along the whole\\r\\nlength of the two outermost longer lines, and tied shorter lines to\\r\\nthem, so that the whole affair then represented the squares of a racket;\\r\\nthe corners of each of which squares i tied very tight with smaller\\r\\npieces of the line, till i had formed a complete net of forty feet long\\r\\nand ten wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen i had finished my net, as i thought, i wrapped several stones\\r\\nin rags, and fastened them to the bottom to sink it, and some of the\\r\\nsmallest unscooped dry gourds to the top, to keep that part buoyant. i\\r\\nnow longed to begin my new trade, and carried the net to my boat with\\r\\nthat intention; but after two or three hauls i found it would not answer\\r\\nfor want of length (though by chance i caught a blackish fish without\\r\\nscales, a little bigger than whiting, but much longer, which stuck by\\r\\nthe gills in it); so i left the net in the boat, resolving to make an\\r\\naddition to it with all speed; and returning to my grotto, i supped on\\r\\nthe fish i had taken and considered how to pursue my enterprise with\\r\\nbetter effect.\\r\\n\\r\\ni provided me with another large parcel of line; and having brought two\\r\\nmore lengths to perfection, i joined all together, and fixing one end\\r\\non shore, by a pole i had cut for that purpose, i launched my boat, with\\r\\nthe other end in it, taking a sweep the length of my net round to\\r\\nmy stick again, and getting on shore, hauled up my net by both ends\\r\\ntogether. i found now i had mended my instrument, and taken a proper way\\r\\nof applying it; for by this means, in five hauls, i caught about sixteen\\r\\nfish of three or four different sorts, and one shell-fish, almost like\\r\\na lobster, but without great claws, and with a very small short tail;\\r\\nwhich made me think, as the body was thrice as long as a lobster\\'s in\\r\\nproportion, that it did not swim backwards, like that creature, but\\r\\nonly crawled forwards (it having lobsterlike legs, but much shorter and\\r\\nstronger), and that the legs all standing so forward, its tail was, by\\r\\nits motion, to keep the hinder part of the body from dragging upon the\\r\\nground, as i observed it did when the creature walked on land, it then\\r\\nfrequently flacking its short tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nthese fish made me rich in provisions. some of them i ate fresh, and the\\r\\nremainder i salted down. but of all the kinds, my lobster was the most\\r\\ndelicious food, and made me almost three meals.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus finding there were fish to be had, though my present tackle seemed\\r\\nsuitable enough to my family, yet could i not rest till i had improved\\r\\nmy fishery by enlarging my net; for as it was, even with my late\\r\\naddition, i must either sweep little or no compass of ground, or it\\r\\nwould have no bag behind me. upon this i set to work and shortly doubled\\r\\nthe dimensions of it. i had then a mind to try it at the mouth of my\\r\\nrill; so taking it with me the next time i crossed the lake for water,\\r\\nand fastening it to my pole, close by the right side of the rill, i\\r\\nswept a long compass round to the left, and closing the ends, attempted\\r\\nto draw it up in the hollow cut of the rill. but by the time i had\\r\\ngathered up two-thirds of the net, i felt a resistance that quite\\r\\namazed me. in short, i was not able to stand against the force i felt.\\r\\nwhereupon sitting down in the rill, and clapping my feet to the two\\r\\nsides of it, i exerted all my strength, till finally i became conqueror,\\r\\nand brought up so shocking a monster, that i was just rising to run\\r\\nfor my life on the sight of it. but recollecting that the creature was\\r\\nhampered, and could not make so much resistance on the land as in the\\r\\nwater, i ventured to drag the net up as far from the rill as my strength\\r\\nand breath would permit me; and then running to the boat for my gun,\\r\\ni returned to the net to examine my prize. indeed, i had not instantly\\r\\nresolution enough to survey it, and when at length i assumed courage\\r\\nenough to do so, i could not perfectly distinguish the parts, they were\\r\\nso discomposed; but taking hold of one end of the net, i endeavoured to\\r\\ndisentangle the thing, and then drawing the net away, a most surprising\\r\\nsight presented itself: the creature reared upright, about three feet\\r\\nhigh, covered all over with long, black shaggy hair, like a bear, which\\r\\nhung down from his head and neck quite along his back and sides. he had\\r\\ntwo fins, very broad and large, which, as he stood erect, looked like\\r\\narms, and these he waved and whirled about with incredible velocity; and\\r\\nthough i wondered at first at it, i found afterwards it was the motion\\r\\nof these fins that kept him upright; for i perceived when they ceased\\r\\ntheir motion he fell flat on his belly. he had two very large feet,\\r\\nwhich he stood upon, but could not run, and but barely walk on them,\\r\\nwhich made me in the less haste to despatch him; and after he had stood\\r\\nupon his feet about four minutes, clapping his fins to his sides, he\\r\\nfell upon his belly.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen i found he could not attack me, i was moving closer to him; but\\r\\nupon sight of my stirring, up he rose again, and whirled his fins about\\r\\nas before so long as he stood. and now i viewed him round, and found\\r\\nhe had no tail at all, and that his hinder fins, or feet, very much\\r\\nresembled a large frog\\'s, but were at least ten inches broad, and\\r\\neighteen long, from heel to toe; and his legs were so short that when he\\r\\nstood upright his breech bore upon the ground. his belly, which he kept\\r\\ntowards me, was of an ash-colour, and very broad, as also was his breast\\r\\nhis eyes were small and blue, with a large black sight in the middle,\\r\\nand rather of an oval than round make. he had a long snout like a boar,\\r\\nand vast teeth. thus having surveyed him near half an hour living, i\\r\\nmade him rise up once more and shot him in the breast. he fell, and\\r\\ngiving a loud howl, or groan, expired.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had then time to see what else i had caught; and turning over the net,\\r\\nfound a few of the same fish i had taken before, and some others of a\\r\\nflat-tish make, and one little lump of flesh unformed; which last, by\\r\\nall i could make of it, seemed to be either a spawn or young one of that\\r\\ni had shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe great creature was so heavy, i was afraid i must have cut him in\\r\\npieces to get him to the boat; but with much ado, having stowed the\\r\\nrest, i tumbled him on board. i then filled my water-cask and rowed\\r\\nhomewards. being got to land, i was obliged to bring down my cart, to\\r\\ncarry my great beast-fish, as i termed him, up to the grotto. when i had\\r\\ngot him thither, i had a notion of first tasting, and then, if i liked\\r\\nhis flesh, of salting him down and drying him; so, having flayed him and\\r\\ntaken out the guts and entrails, i boiled a piece of him; but it made\\r\\nsuch a blaze that most of the fat ran into the fire, and the flesh\\r\\nproved so dry and rank that i could no ways endure it.\\r\\n\\r\\ni then began to be sorry i had taken so much pains for no profit, and\\r\\nhad endangered my net into the bargain (for that had got a crack or two\\r\\nin the scuffle), and was thinking to throw away my large but worthless\\r\\nacquisition.\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever, as i was now prone to weighing all things, before i threw it\\r\\naway i resolved to consider a little; whereupon i changed my mind.\\r\\nsays i, here is a good warm skin, which, when dry, will make me a rare\\r\\ncushion. again, i have for a long while had no light beside that of the\\r\\nday; but now as this beast\\'s fat makes such a blaze in the fire, and\\r\\nissues in so great a quantity from such a small piece as i broiled, why\\r\\nmay not i boil a good tallow or oil out of it? and if i can, i have not\\r\\nmade so bad a hand of my time as i thought for.\\r\\n\\r\\nin short, i went immediately to work upon this subject (for i never let\\r\\na project cool after i had once started it), and boiled as much of the\\r\\nflesh as the kettle would hold, and letting it stand to cool, i found\\r\\nit turned out very good oil for burning; though i confess i thought it\\r\\nwould rather have made tallow. this success quickened my industry; and i\\r\\nrepeated the operation till i got about ten quarts of this stuff, which\\r\\nvery well rewarded my labour. after i had extracted as much oil as i\\r\\ncould from the beast-fish, the creature having strongly impressed my\\r\\nimagination, i conceived a new fancy in relation to it; and that was,\\r\\nhaving heard him make a deep, howling groan at his death, i endeavoured\\r\\nto persuade myself, and at last verily believed, that the voices i\\r\\nhad so often heard in the dark weather proceeded from numbers of these\\r\\ncreatures, diverting themselves in the lake, or sporting together on\\r\\nthe shore; and this thought, in its turn, contributed to ease my\\r\\napprehensions in that respect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xiv.\\r\\n\\r\\n     the author passes the summer pleasantly--hears the voices in\\r\\n     the winter--ventures out--sees a strange sight on the lake--\\r\\n     his uneasiness at it--his dream--soliloquy--hears the\\r\\n     voices again, and perceives a great shock on his building--\\r\\n     takes up a beautiful woman--he thinks her dead, but recovers\\r\\n     her--a description of her--she stays with him\\r\\n\\r\\ni passed the summer (though i had never yet seen the sun\\'s body) very\\r\\nmuch to my satisfaction: partly in the work i have been describing (for\\r\\ni had taken two more of the beast-fish, and had a great quantity of oil\\r\\nfrom them); partly in building me a chimney in my ante-chamber of mud\\r\\nand earth burnt on my own hearth into a sort of brick; in making a\\r\\nwindow at one end of the abovesaid chamber, to let in what little light\\r\\nwould come through the trees when i did not choose to open my door;\\r\\nin moulding an earthen lamp for my oil; and, finally, in providing and\\r\\nlaying in stores, fresh and salt (for i had now cured and dried many\\r\\nmore fish), against winter. these, i say, were my summer employments\\r\\nat home, intermixed with many agreeable excursions. but now the winter\\r\\ncoming on, and the days growing very short, or indeed there being no\\r\\nday properly speaking, but a kind of twilight, i kept mostly in my\\r\\nhabitation, though not so much as i had done the winter before, when i\\r\\nhad no light within doors, and slept, or at least lay still, great\\r\\npart of my time; for now my lamp was never out. i also turned two of\\r\\nmy beast-fish skins into a rug to cover my bed, and the third into a\\r\\ncushion, which i always sat upon, and a very soft and warm cushion\\r\\nit made. all this together rendered my life very easy, yea, even\\r\\ncomfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nan indifferent person would now be apt to ask, what would this man\\r\\ndesire more than he had? to this i answer, that i was contented while my\\r\\ncondition was such as i have been describing; but a little while after\\r\\nthe darkness or twilight came on, i frequently heard the voices again;\\r\\nsometimes a few only at a time, as it seemed, and then again in great\\r\\nnumbers. this threw me into new fears, and i became as uneasy as ever,\\r\\neven to the degree of growing quite melancholy; though, otherwise, i\\r\\nnever received the least injury from anything. i foolishly attempted\\r\\nseveral times, by looking out of my window, to discover what these odd\\r\\nsounds proceeded from, though i knew it was too dark to see anything\\r\\nthere.\\r\\n\\r\\ni was now fully convinced, by a more deliberate attention to them, that\\r\\nthey could not be uttered by the beast-fish, as i had afore conjectured,\\r\\nbut only by beings capable of articulate speech; but then, what or where\\r\\nthey were, it galled me to be ignorant of.\\r\\n\\r\\nat length, one night or day, i cannot say which, hearing the voices very\\r\\ndistinctly, and praying very earnestly to be either delivered from the\\r\\nuncertainty they had put me under, or to have them removed from me, i\\r\\ntook courage, and arming myself with gun, pistols, and cutlass, i went\\r\\nout of my grotto and crept down the wood. i then heard them plainer\\r\\nthan before, and was able to judge from what point of the compass they\\r\\nproceeded. hereupon i went forward towards the sound, till i came to the\\r\\nverge of the wood, where i could see the lake very well by the dazzle of\\r\\nthe water. thereon, as i thought, i beheld a fleet of boats, covering a\\r\\nlarge compass, and not far from the bridge. i was shocked hereat beyond\\r\\nexpression. i could not conceive where they came from, or whither they\\r\\nwould go; but supposed there must be some other passage to the lake than\\r\\ni had found in my voyage through the cavern, and that for certain they\\r\\ncame that way, and from some place of which as yet i had no manner of\\r\\nknowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhilst i was entertaining myself with this speculation, i heard the\\r\\npeople in the boats laughing and talking very merrily, though i was too\\r\\ndistant to distinguish the words. i discerned soon after all the boats\\r\\n(as i still supposed \\'em) draw up, and push for the bridge; presently\\r\\nafter, though i was sure no boat entered the arch, i saw a multitude of\\r\\npeople on the opposite shore all marching towards the bridge; and what\\r\\nwas the strangest of all, there was not the least sign of a boat now\\r\\nleft upon the whole lake. i then was in a greater consternation than\\r\\nbefore; but was still much more so when i saw the whole posse of people,\\r\\nthat as i have just said were marching towards the bridge, coming over\\r\\nit to my side of the lake. at this my heart failed, and i was just going\\r\\nto run to my grotto for shelter; but taking one look more, i plainly\\r\\ndiscovered that the people, leaping one after another from the top of\\r\\nthe bridge, as if into the water, and then rising again, flew in a\\r\\nlong train over the lake, the lengthways of it, quite out of my sight,\\r\\nlaughing, hallooing, and sporting together; so that looking back again\\r\\nto the bridge and on the lake, i could neither see person nor boat,\\r\\nnor anything else, nor hear the least noise or stir afterwards for that\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\ni returned to my grotto brimful of this amazing adventure, bemoaning my\\r\\nmisfortune in being at a place where i was like to remain ignorant of\\r\\nwhat was doing about me. for, says i, if i am in a land of spirits, as\\r\\nnow i have little room to doubt, there is no guarding against them. i am\\r\\nnever safe, even in my grotto; for that can be no security against such\\r\\nbeings as can sail on the water in no boats, and fly in the air on no\\r\\nwings, as the case now appears to me, who can be here and there and\\r\\nwherever they please. what a miserable state, i say, am i fallen to!\\r\\ni should have been glad to have had human converse, and to have found\\r\\ninhabitants in this place; but there being none, as i supposed hitherto,\\r\\ni contented myself with thinking that i was at least safe from all those\\r\\nevils mankind in society are obnoxious to. but now, what may be the\\r\\nconsequence of the next hour i know not; nay, i am not able to say but\\r\\nwhilst i speak, and show my discontent, they may at a distance conceive\\r\\nmy thoughts, and be hatching revenge against me for my dislike of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe pressure of my spirits inclining me to repose, i laid me down, but\\r\\ncould get no rest; nor could all my most serious thoughts, even of the\\r\\nalmighty providence, give me relief under my present anxiety: and all\\r\\nthis was only from my state of uncertainty concerning the reality of\\r\\nwhat i had heard and seen, and from the earnestness with which i coveted\\r\\na satisfactory knowledge of those beings who had just taken their flight\\r\\nfrom me.\\r\\n\\r\\ni really believe the fiercest wild beast, or the most savage of mankind\\r\\nthat had met me, and put me upon my defence, would not have given me\\r\\nhalf the trouble that then lay upon me; and the more, for that i had no\\r\\nseeming possibility of ever being rid of my apprehensions: so finding i\\r\\ncould not sleep, i got up again; but as i could not fly from myself, all\\r\\nthe art i could use with myself was but in vain to obtain me any quiet.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the height of my distress i had recourse to prayer, with no small\\r\\nbenefit; begging that if it pleased not the almighty power to remove\\r\\nthe object of my fears, at least to resolve my doubts about them, and to\\r\\nrender them rather helpful than hurtful to me. i hereupon, as i always\\r\\ndid on such occasions, found myself much more placid and easy, and began\\r\\nto hope the best, till i had almost persuaded myself that i was out of\\r\\ndanger; and then laying myself down, i rested very sweetly till i was\\r\\nawakened by the impulse of the following dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nmethought i was in cornwall, at my wife\\'s aunt\\'s; and inquiring after\\r\\nher and my children, the old gentlewoman informed me, both my wife\\r\\nand children had been dead some time, and that my wife, before her\\r\\ndeparture, desired her (that is, her aunt) immediately upon my arrival\\r\\nto tell me she was only gone to the lake, where i should be sure to see\\r\\nher, and be happy with her ever after. i then, as i fancied, ran to\\r\\nthe lake to find her. in my passage she stopped me, crying, \"whither so\\r\\nfast, peter? i am your wife, your patty.\" methought i did not know her,\\r\\nshe was so altered; but observing her voice, and looking more wistfully\\r\\nat her, she appeared to me as the most beautiful creature i ever\\r\\nbeheld. i then went to seize her in my arms; but the hurry of my spirits\\r\\nawakened me.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen i got up, i kept at home, not caring even to look out at my door.\\r\\nmy dream ran strangely in my head, and i had now nothing but patty in my\\r\\nmind. \"oh!\" cries i, \"how happy could i be with her, though i had only\\r\\nher in this solitude. oh! that this was but a reality, and not a dream.\"\\r\\nand indeed, though it was but a dream, i could scarce refrain from\\r\\nrunning to the lake to meet my patty. but then i checked my folly, and\\r\\nreasoned myself into some degree of temper again. however, i could not\\r\\nforbear crying out, \"what, nobody to converse with! nobody to assist,\\r\\ncomfort, or counsel me! this is a melancholy situation indeed.\" thus i\\r\\nran on lamenting till i was almost weary, when on a sudden i again\\r\\nheard the voices. \"hark!\" says i, \"here they come again. well, i am now\\r\\nresolved to face them, come life, come death! it is not to be alone i\\r\\nthus dread; but to have company about me, and not know who or what, is\\r\\ndeath to me worse than i can suffer from them, be they who or what they\\r\\nwill.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nduring my soliloquy the voices increased, and then by degrees diminished\\r\\nas usual; but i had scarce got my gun in my hand, to pursue my\\r\\nresolution of showing myself to those who uttered them, when i felt such\\r\\na thump upon the roof of my ante-chamber as shook the whole fabric and\\r\\nset me all over into a tremor. i then heard a sort of shriek, and a\\r\\nrustle near the door of my apartment; all which together seemed very\\r\\nterrible. but i, having before determined to see what and who it was,\\r\\nresolutely opened my door and leaped out i saw nobody; all was quite\\r\\nsilent, and nothing that i could perceive but my own fears amoving. i\\r\\nwent then softly to the corner of the building, and there looking down,\\r\\nby the glimmer of my lamp which stood in the window, i saw something in\\r\\nhuman shape lying at my feet. i gave the word, \"who is there?\" still no\\r\\none answered. my heart was ready to force a way through my side. i was\\r\\nfor a while fixed to the earth like a statue. at length, recovering, i\\r\\nstepped in, fetched my lamp, and returning saw the very beautiful face\\r\\nmy patty appeared under in my dream; and not considering that it was\\r\\nonly a dream, i verily thought i had my patty before me; but she seemed\\r\\nto be stone dead. upon viewing her other parts (for i had never yet\\r\\nremoved my eyes from her face), i found she had a sort of brown chaplet,\\r\\nlike lace, round her head, under and about which her hair was tucked up\\r\\nand twined; and she seemed to me to be clothed in a thin hair-coloured\\r\\nsilk garment, which, upon trying to raise her, i found to be quite warm,\\r\\nand therefore hoped there was life in the body it contained. i then took\\r\\nher into my arms, and treading a step backwards with her, i put out my\\r\\nlamp; however, having her in my arms, i conveyed her through the doorway\\r\\nin the dark into my grotto; here i laid her upon my bed, and then ran\\r\\nout for my lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis, thinks i, is an amazing adventure. how could patty come here, and\\r\\ndressed in silk and whalebone too? sure that is not the reigning fashion\\r\\nin england now? but my dream said she was dead. why, truly, says i, so\\r\\nshe seems to be. but be it so; she is warm. whether this is the place\\r\\nfor persons to inhabit after death or not, i can\\'t tell (for i see there\\r\\nare people here, though i don\\'t know them); but be it as it will, she\\r\\nfeels as flesh and blood; and if i can but bring her to stir and act\\r\\nagain as my wife, what matters it to me what she is? it will be a great\\r\\nblessing and comfort to me; for she never would have come to this very\\r\\nspot but for my good.\\r\\n\\r\\ntop-full of these thoughts, i re-entered my grotto, shut my door and\\r\\nlighted my lamp; when going to my patty (as i delighted to fancy her),\\r\\ni thought i saw her eyes stir a little. i then set the lamp farther off\\r\\nfor fear of offending them if she should look up; and warming the last\\r\\nglass i had reserved of my madeira, i carried it to her, but she never\\r\\nstirred. i now supposed the fall had absolutely killed her, and was\\r\\nprodigiously grieved; when laying my hand on her breast i perceived the\\r\\nfountain of life had some motion. this gave me infinite pleasure; so,\\r\\nnot despairing, i dipped my finger in the wine and moistened her lips\\r\\nwith it two or three times, and i imagined they opened a little. upon\\r\\nthis i bethought me, and taking a teaspoon, i gently poured a few drops\\r\\nof the wine by that means into her mouth. finding she swallowed it, i\\r\\npoured in another spoonful, and another, till i brought her to herself\\r\\nso well as to be able to sit up. all this i did by a glimmering light\\r\\nwhich the lamp afforded from a distant part of the room, where i had\\r\\nplaced it, as i have said, out of her sight.\\r\\n\\r\\ni then spoke to her, and asked divers questions, as if she had really\\r\\nbeen patty and understood me; in return of which she uttered a language\\r\\ni had no idea of, though in the most musical tone, and with the sweetest\\r\\naccent i ever heard. it grieved me i could not understand her. however,\\r\\nthinking she might like to be on her feet, i went to lift her off the\\r\\nbed, when she felt to my touch in the oddest manner imaginable; for\\r\\nwhile in one respect it was as though she had been cased up in whalebone\\r\\nit was at the same time as soft and warm as if she had been naked.\\r\\n\\r\\ni then took her in my arms and carried her into my ante-chamber again,\\r\\nwhere i would fain have entered into conversation, but found she and\\r\\ni could make nothing of it together, unless we could understand one\\r\\nanother\\'s speech. it is very strange my dream should have prepossessed\\r\\nme so of patty, and of the alteration of her countenance, that i could\\r\\nby no means persuade myself the person i had with me was not she;\\r\\nthough, upon a deliberate comparison, patty, as pleasing as she always\\r\\nwas to my taste, would no more come up to this fair creature than a\\r\\ncoarse ale-wife would to venus herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nyou may imagine we stared heartily at each other, and i doubted not but\\r\\nshe wondered as much as i by what means we came so near each other. i\\r\\noffered her everything in my grotto which i thought might please her;\\r\\nsome of which she gratefully received, as appeared by her looks and\\r\\nbehaviour. but she avoided my lamp, and always placed her back toward\\r\\nit. i observing that, and ascribing it to her modesty in my company, let\\r\\nher have her will, and took care to set it in such a position myself as\\r\\nseemed agreeable to her, though it deprived me of a prospect i very much\\r\\nadmired.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter we had sat a good while, now and then, i may say, chattering to\\r\\none another, she got up and took a turn or two about the room. when i\\r\\nsaw her in that attitude, her grace and motion perfectly charmed me, and\\r\\nher shape was incomparable; but the strangeness of her dress put me to\\r\\nmy trumps to conceive either what it was, or how it was put on.\\r\\n\\r\\nwell, we supped together, and i set the best of everything i had before\\r\\nher, nor could either of us forbear speaking in our own tongue, though\\r\\nwe were sensible neither of us understood the other. after supper i\\r\\ngave her some of my cordials, for which she showed great tokens of\\r\\nthankfulness, and often in her way, by signs and gestures, which were\\r\\nvery far from being insignificant, expressed her gratitude for my\\r\\nkindness. when supper had been some time over, i showed her my bed and\\r\\nmade signs for her to go to it; but she seemed very shy of that, till i\\r\\nshowed her where i meant to lie myself, by pointing to myself, then to\\r\\nthat, and again pointing to her and to my bed. when at length i had made\\r\\nthis matter intelligible to her, she lay down very composedly; and after\\r\\ni had taken care of my fire, and set the things i had been using for\\r\\nsupper in their places, i laid myself down too; for i could have no\\r\\nsuspicious thoughts or fear of danger from a form so excellent.\\r\\n\\r\\ni treated her for some time with all the respect imaginable, and never\\r\\nsuffered her to do the least part of my work. it was very inconvenient\\r\\nto both of us only to know each other\\'s meaning by signs; but i could\\r\\nnot be otherwise than pleased to see that she endeavoured all in her\\r\\npower to learn to talk like me. indeed i was not behindhand with her in\\r\\nthat respect, striving all i could to imitate her. what i all the while\\r\\nwondered at was, she never showed the least disquiet at her confinement;\\r\\nfor i kept my door shut at first, through fear of losing her, thinking\\r\\nshe would have taken an opportunity to run away from me; for little did\\r\\ni then think she could fly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xv.\\r\\n\\r\\n     wilkin s afraid of losing his new mistress--they live\\r\\n     together all winter--a remark on that--they begin to know\\r\\n     each other\\'s language--a long discourse between them at\\r\\n     cross purposes--she flies--they engage to be man and wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter my new love had been with me a fortnight, finding my water run\\r\\nlow, i was greatly troubled at the thought of quitting her any time to\\r\\ngo for more; and having hinted it to her, with seeming uneasiness,\\r\\nshe could not for a while fathom my meaning; but when she saw me much\\r\\nconfused, she came at length, by the many signs i made, to imagine it\\r\\nwas my concern for her which made me so; whereupon she expressively\\r\\nenough signified i might be easy, for she did not fear anything\\r\\nhappening to her in my absence. on this, as well as i could declare my\\r\\nmeaning, i entreated her not to go away before my return. as soon as she\\r\\nunderstood what i signified to her by actions, she sat down, with her\\r\\narms across, leaning her head against the wall to assure me she would\\r\\nnot stir. however, as i had before nailed a cord to the outside of the\\r\\ndoor, i tied that for caution\\'s sake to the tree, for fear of the worst:\\r\\nbut i believe she had not the least design of removing.\\r\\n\\r\\ni took my boat, net, and water-cask, as usual, desirous of bringing her\\r\\nhome a fresh fish dinner, and succeeded so well as to catch enough for\\r\\nseveral good meals, and to spare. what remained i salted, and found she\\r\\nliked that better than the fresh, after a few days\\' salting; though she\\r\\ndid not so well approve of that i had formerly pickled and dried. as my\\r\\nsalt grew very low, though i had been as sparing of it as possible, i\\r\\nnow resolved to try making some; and the next summer i effected it.\\r\\n\\r\\nthus we spent the remainder of the winter together, till the days began\\r\\nto be light enough for me to walk abroad a little in the middle of\\r\\nthem; for i was now under no apprehensions of her leaving me, as she had\\r\\nbefore this time had so many opportunities of doing so, but never once\\r\\nattempted it.\\r\\n\\r\\ni must here make one reflection upon our conduct, which you will almost\\r\\nthink incredible, viz., that we two, of different sexes, not wanting our\\r\\npeculiar desires, fully inflamed with love to each other, and no outward\\r\\nobstacle to prevent our wishes, should have been together, under the\\r\\nsame roof alone for five months, conversing together from morning to\\r\\nnight (for by this time she pretty well understood english, and i her\\r\\nlanguage), and yet i should never have clasped her in my arms, or have\\r\\nshown any further amorous desires to her than what the deference i all\\r\\nalong paid her could give her room to surmise. nay, i can affirm that\\r\\ni did not even then know that the covering she wore was not the work of\\r\\nart, but the work of nature, for i really took it for silk; though it\\r\\nmust be premised that i had never seen it by any other light than of my\\r\\nlamp. indeed the modesty of her carriage and sweetness of her behaviour\\r\\nto me had struck into me such a dread of offending her, that though\\r\\nnothing upon earth could be more capable of exciting passion than her\\r\\ncharms, i could have died rather than have attempted only to salute her\\r\\nwithout actual invitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen the weather cleared up a little by the lengthening of daylight, i\\r\\ntook courage one afternoon to invite her to walk with me to the lake;\\r\\nbut she sweetly excused herself from it, whilst there was such a\\r\\nfrightful glare of light, as she said; but looking out at the door,\\r\\ntold me, if i would not go out of the wood she would accompany me: so we\\r\\nagreed to take a turn only there. i first went myself over the stile of\\r\\nthe door, and thinking it rather too high for her, i took her in my arms\\r\\nand lifted her over. but even when i had her in this manner, i knew not\\r\\nwhat to make of her clothing, it sat so true and close; but seeing by a\\r\\nsteadier and truer light in the grove, though a heavy gloomy one, than\\r\\nmy lamp had afforded, i begged she would let me know of what silk or\\r\\nother composition her garment was made. she smiled, and asked me if mine\\r\\nwas not the same under my jacket \"no, lady,\" says i, \"i have nothing\\r\\nbut my skin under my clothes.\"--\"why, what do you mean?\" replies she,\\r\\nsomewhat tartly; \"but indeed i was afraid that something was the matter\\r\\nby that nasty covering you wear, that you might not be seen. are you\\r\\nnot a glumm?\"*--\"yes,\"says i, \"fair creature.\" (here, though you may\\r\\nconceive she spoke part english, part her own tongue, and i the same, as\\r\\nwe best understood each other, yet i shall give you our discourse, word\\r\\nfor word, in plain english.) \"then,\" says she, \"i am afraid you must\\r\\nhave been a very bad man, and have been crashee,** which i should be\\r\\nvery sorry to hear.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     * a  man.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ** slit.\\r\\n\\r\\ni told her i believed we were none of us so good as we might be, but i\\r\\nhoped my faults had not at most exceeded other men\\'s; but i had suffered\\r\\nabundance of hardships in my time; and that at last providence\\r\\nhaving settled me in this spot, from whence i had no prospect of ever\\r\\ndeparting, it was none of the least of its mercies to bring to my\\r\\nknowledge and company the most exquisite piece of all his works, in her,\\r\\nwhich i should acknowledge as long as i lived. she was surprised at this\\r\\ndiscourse, and asked me (if i did not mean to impose upon her, and was\\r\\nindeed an ingcrashee* glumm) why i should tell her i had no prospect of\\r\\ndeparting hence. \"have not you,\" says she, \"the same prospect that i or\\r\\nany other person has of departing? sir,\" added she, \"you don\\'t do\\r\\nwell, and really i fear you are slit, or you would not wear this nasty\\r\\ncumbersome coat (taking hold of my jacket-sleeve), if you were not\\r\\nafraid of showing the signs of a bad life upon your natural clothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     * unslit.\\r\\n\\r\\ni could not for my heart imagine what way there was to get out of my\\r\\ndominions. but certainly, thought i, there must be some way or other, or\\r\\nshe would not be so peremptory. and as to my jacket, and showing myself\\r\\nin my natural clothing, i profess she made me blush; and but for shame,\\r\\ni would have stripped to my skin to have satisfied her. \"but, madam,\"\\r\\nsays i, \"pray pardon me, for you are really mistaken; i have examined\\r\\nevery nook and corner of this new world in which we now are, and can\\r\\nfind no possible outlet; nay, even by the same way i came in, i am sure\\r\\nit is impossible to get out again.\"--\"why,\" says she, \"what outlets have\\r\\nyou searched for, or what way can you expect out but the way you came\\r\\nin? and why is that impossible to return by again? if you are not slit,\\r\\nis not the air open to you? will not the sky admit you to patrole in it,\\r\\nas well as other people? i tell you, sir, i fear you have been slit for\\r\\nyour crimes; and though you have been so good to me, that i can\\'t help\\r\\nloving of you heartily for it, yet if i thought you had been slit, i\\r\\nwould not, nay, could not, stay a moment longer with you; no, though it\\r\\nshould break my heart to leave you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\ni found myself now in a strange quandary, longing to know what she meant\\r\\nby being slit, and had a hundred strange notions in my head whether i\\r\\nwas slit or not; for though i knew what the word naturally signified\\r\\nwell enough, yet in what manner or by what figure of speech she applied\\r\\nit to me, i had no idea of. but seeing her look a little angrily upon\\r\\nme, \"pray, madam,\" says i, \"don\\'t be offended, if i take the liberty to\\r\\nask you what you mean by the word crashee* so often repeated by you; for\\r\\ni am an utter stranger to what you mean by it.\"--\"sir,\" says she, \"pray\\r\\nanswer me first how you came here?\"--\"madam,\" replied i, \"will you\\r\\nplease to take a walk to the verge of the wood, i will show you the very\\r\\npassage.\"--\"sir,\" says she, \"i perfectly know the range of the rocks all\\r\\nround, and by the least description, without going to see them, can tell\\r\\nfrom which you descended.\"--\"in truth,\" said i, \"most charming lady, i\\r\\ndescended from no rock at all; nor would i for a thousand worlds attempt\\r\\nwhat could not be accomplished but by my destruction.\"--\"sir,\" says\\r\\nshe, in some anger, \"it is false, and you impose upon me.\"--\"i declare\\r\\nto you,\" says i, \"madam, what i tell you is strictly true; i never was\\r\\nnear the summit of any of the surrounding rocks, or anything like it;\\r\\nbut as you are not far from the verge of the wood, be so good as to step\\r\\na little farther and i will show you my entrance in hither.\"--\"well,\"\\r\\nsays she, \"now this odious dazzle of light is lessened, i don\\'t care if\\r\\ni do go with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we came far enough to see the bridge, \"there, madam,\" says i,\\r\\n\"there is my entrance, where the sea pours into this lake from yonder\\r\\ncavern.\"--\"it is not possible,\" says she; \"this is another untruth; and\\r\\nas i see you would deceive me, and are not to be believed, farewell; i\\r\\nmust be gone. but, hold,\" says she, \"let me ask you one thing more; that\\r\\nis, by what means did you come through that cavern? you could not have\\r\\nused to have come over the rock?\"--\"bless me, madam!\" says i, \"do you\\r\\nthink i and my boat could fly? come over the rock, did you say? no,\\r\\nmadam; i sailed from the great sea, the main ocean, in my boat, through\\r\\nthat cavern into this very lake here.\"--\"what do you mean by your boat?\"\\r\\nsays she. \"you seem to make two things of your boat you say you sailed\\r\\nwith and yourself.\"--\"i do so,\" replied i; \"for, madam, i take myself\\r\\nto be good flesh and blood, but my boat is made of wood and other\\r\\nmaterials.\"--\"is it so?\" says she. \"and, pray, where is this boat\\r\\nthat is made of wood and other materials?--under your jacket?\"--\"lord,\\r\\nmadam!\" says i, \"you put me in fear that you were angry; but now i hope\\r\\nyou only joke with me. what, put a boat under my jacket! no, madam; my\\r\\nboat is in the lake.\"--\"what, more untruths?\" says she.--\"no, madam,\" i\\r\\nreplied; \"if you would be satisfied of what i say (every word of which\\r\\nis as true as that my boat now is in the lake), pray walk with me\\r\\nthither and make your own eyes judges what sincerity i speak with.\" to\\r\\nthis she agreed, it growing dusky; but assured me, if i did not give her\\r\\ngood satisfaction, i should see her no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe arrived at the lake; and going to my wet-dock, \"now, madam,\" says\\r\\ni, \"pray satisfy yourself whether i spake true or no.\" she looked at my\\r\\nboat, but could not yet frame a proper notion of it. says i, \"madam,\\r\\nin this very boat i sailed from the main ocean through that cavern into\\r\\nthis lake; and shall at last think myself the happiest of all men if you\\r\\ncontinue with me, love me, and credit me; and i promise you i\\'ll never\\r\\ndeceive you, but think my life happily spent in your service.\" i found\\r\\nshe was hardly content yet to believe what i told her of my boat to be\\r\\ntrue; till i stepped into it, and pushing from the shore, took my oars\\r\\nin my hand, and sailed along the lake by her, as she walked on the\\r\\nshore. at last she seemed so well reconciled to me and my boat, that she\\r\\ndesired i would take her in. i immediately did so, and we sailed a good\\r\\nway; and as we returned to my dock i described to her how i procured the\\r\\nwater we drank, and brought it to shore in that vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"well,\" says she, \"i have sailed, as you call it, many a mile in my\\r\\nlifetime, but never in such a thing as this. i own it will serve very\\r\\nwell where one has a great many things to carry from place to place; but\\r\\nto be labouring thus at an oar when one intends pleasure in sailing, is\\r\\nin my mind a most ridiculous piece of slavery.\"--\"why, pray, madam, how\\r\\nwould you have me sail? for getting into the boat only will not carry\\r\\nus this way or that without using some force.\"--\"but,\" says she, \"pray,\\r\\nwhere did you get this boat, as you call it?\"--\"o madam!\" says i, \"that\\r\\nis too long and fatal a story to begin upon now; this boat was made many\\r\\nthousand miles from hence, among a people coal-black, a quite different\\r\\nsort from us; and, when i first had it, i little thought of seeing this\\r\\ncountry; but i will make a faithful relation of all to you when we come\\r\\nhome.\" indeed, i began to wish heartily we were there, for it grew into\\r\\nthe night; and having strolled so far without my gun, i was afraid of\\r\\nwhat i had before seen and heard, and hinted our return; but i found my\\r\\nmotion was disagreeable to her, and so i dropped it.\\r\\n\\r\\ni now perceived and wondered at it, that the later it grew the\\r\\nmore agreeable it seemed to her; and as i had now brought her into\\r\\ngood-humour again by seeing and sailing in my boat, i was not willing\\r\\nto prevent its increase. i told her, if she pleased, we would land, and\\r\\nwhen i had docked my boat, i would accompany her where and as long as\\r\\nshe liked. as we talked and walked by the lake, she made a little run\\r\\nbefore me and sprung into it perceiving this, i cried out, whereupon\\r\\nshe merrily called on me to follow her. the light was then so dim, as\\r\\nprevented my having more than a confused sight of her when she jumped\\r\\nin; and looking earnestly after her, i could discern nothing more than\\r\\na small boat in the water, which skimmed along at so great a rate that i\\r\\nalmost lost sight of it presently; but running along the shore for\\r\\nfear of losing her, i met her gravely walking to meet me, and then\\r\\nhad entirely lost sight of the boat upon the lake. \"this,\" says she,\\r\\naccosting me with a smile, \"is my way of sailing, which, i perceive, by\\r\\nthe fright you were in, you are altogether unacquainted with; and, as\\r\\nyou tell me you came from so many thousand miles off, it is possible\\r\\nyou may be made differently from me: but, surely we are the part of the\\r\\ncreation which has had most care bestowed upon it; and i suspect, from\\r\\nall your discourse, to which i have been very attentive, it is possible\\r\\nyou may no more be able to fly than to sail as i do.\"--\"no, charming\\r\\ncreature,\" says i, \"that i cannot, i\\'ll assure you.\" she then, stepping\\r\\nto the edge of the lake, for the advantage of a descent before her,\\r\\nsprung up into the air, and away she went farther than my eyes could\\r\\nfollow her.\\r\\n\\r\\ni was quite astonished. \"so,\" says i, \"then all is over! all a delusion\\r\\nwhich i have so long been in! a mere phantom! better had it been for me\\r\\nnever to have seen her, than thus to lose her again! but what could\\r\\ni expect had she stayed? for it is plain she is no human composition.\\r\\nbut,\" says i, \"she felt like flesh, too, when i lifted her out at the\\r\\ndoor!\" i had but very little time for reflection; for, in about ten\\r\\nminutes after she had left me in this mixture of grief and amazement,\\r\\nshe alighted just by me on her feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nher return, as she plainly saw, filled me with a transport not to be\\r\\nconcealed; and which, as she afterwards told me, was very agreeable to\\r\\nher. indeed, i was some moments in such an agitation of mind from these\\r\\nunparalleled incidents, that i was like one thunder-struck; but coming\\r\\npresently to myself, and clasping her in my arms with as much love and\\r\\npassion as i was capable of expressing, and for the first time with\\r\\nany desire,--\"are you returned again, kind angel,\" said i, \"to bless a\\r\\nwretch who can only be happy in adoring you? can it be, that you, who\\r\\nhave so many advantages over me, should quit all the pleasures that\\r\\nnature has formed you for, and all your friends and relations, to take\\r\\nan asylum in my arms? but i here make you a tender of all i am able\\r\\nto bestow--my love and constancy.\"--\"come, come,\" says she, \"no more\\r\\nraptures; i find you are a worthier man than i thought i had reason\\r\\nto take you for, and i beg your pardon for my distrust whilst i was\\r\\nignorant of your imperfections; but now i verily believe all you have\\r\\nsaid is true; and i promise you, as you have seemed so much to delight\\r\\nin me, i will never quit you till death, or other as fatal accident\\r\\nshall part us. but we will now, if you choose, go home; for i know you\\r\\nhave been some time uneasy in this gloom, though agreeable to me: for,\\r\\ngiving my eyes the pleasure of looking eagerly on you, it conceals my\\r\\nblushes from your sight.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nin this manner, exchanging mutual endearments and soft speeches, hand\\r\\nin hand, we arrived at the grotto; where we that night consummated our\\r\\nnuptials, without farther ceremony than mutual solemn engagements to\\r\\neach other; which are, in truth, the essence of marriage, and all that\\r\\nwas there and then in our power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xvi.\\r\\n\\r\\n     the author\\'s disappointment at first going to bed with his\\r\\n     new wife--some strange circumstances relating thereto--she\\r\\n     resolves several questions he asks her, and clears up his\\r\\n     fears as to the voices--a description of swangeans.\\r\\n\\r\\nevery calm is succeeded by a storm, as is every storm by its calm; for,\\r\\nafter supper, in order to give my bride the opportunity of undressing\\r\\nalone, which i thought might be most agreeable the first night, i\\r\\nwithdrew into the antechamber till i thought she was laid; and then,\\r\\nhaving first disposed of my lamp, i moved softly towards her, and\\r\\nstepped into bed too; when, on my nearer approach to her, i imagined she\\r\\nhad her clothes on. this struck a thorough damp over me; and asking her\\r\\nthe reason of it, not being able to touch the least bit of her flesh\\r\\nbut her face and hands, she burst out a-laugh-ing; and, running her hand\\r\\nalong my naked side, soon perceived the difference she before had made\\r\\nsuch doubt of between herself and me. upon which she fairly told me,\\r\\nthat neither she, nor any person she had ever seen before, had any\\r\\nother covering than what they were born with, and which they would not\\r\\nwillingly part with but with their lives. this shocked me terribly;\\r\\nnot from the horror of the thing itself, or any distaste i had to this\\r\\ncovering (for it was quite smooth, warm, and softer than velvet or the\\r\\nfinest skin imaginable), but from an apprehension of her being so wholly\\r\\nencased in it, that, though i had so fine a companion, and now a\\r\\nwife, yet i should have no conjugal benefit from her, either to my own\\r\\ngratification, or the increase of our species.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the height of my impatience i made divers essays for unfolding this\\r\\ncovering, but unsuccessfully. surely, says i, there must be some way of\\r\\ncoming at my wishes, or why should she seem so shy of me at first, and\\r\\nnow we are under engagements to each other, meet me half way with such a\\r\\nyielding compliance? i could, if i had had time to spare, have gone on,\\r\\nstarting objections and answering them, in my own breast, a great while\\r\\nlonger (for i now knew not what to make of it); but being prompted to\\r\\nact as well as think, and feeling, as tenderly as possible, upon her\\r\\nbosom, for the folds or plaits of her garment, she lying perfectly\\r\\nstill, and perceiving divers flat broad ledges, like whale-bone,\\r\\nseemingly under her covering, which closely enfolded her body, i thought\\r\\nit might be all laced on together somewhat like stays, and felt behind\\r\\nfor the lacing.\\r\\n\\r\\nat length, perceiving me so puzzled, and beyond conception vexed at my\\r\\ndisappointment, of asudden, lest i should grow outrageous (which i was\\r\\nalmost come to), she threw down all those seeming ribs flat to her side\\r\\nso imperceptibly to me, that i knew nothing of the matter, though i lay\\r\\nclose to her; till putting forth my hand again to her bosom, the softest\\r\\nskin, and most delightful body, free from all impediment, presented\\r\\nitself to my wishes, and gave itself up to my embraces.\\r\\n\\r\\ni slept very soundly till morning, and so did she; but at waking i was\\r\\nvery solicitous to find out what sort of being i had had in my arms,\\r\\nand with what qualities her garment was endued, or how contrived that,\\r\\nnotwithstanding all my fruitless attempts to uncover her, she herself\\r\\ncould so instantaneously dispose of it undiscerned by me. well, thought\\r\\ni, she is my wife, i will be satisfied in everything; for surely she\\r\\nwill not now refuse to gratify my curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe rose with the light; but surely no two were ever more amorous, or\\r\\nmore delighted with each other. i, being up first, lighted the fire, and\\r\\nprepared breakfast of some fish soup, thickened with my cream-cheese;\\r\\nand then calling her, i kept my eye towards the bed to see how she\\r\\ndressed herself; but throwing aside the clothes, she stepped out ready\\r\\ndressed, and came to me. when i had kissed her, and wished her a good\\r\\nday, we sat down to breakfast; which being soon over, i told her i hoped\\r\\nevery minute of our lives would prove as happy as those we so lately\\r\\npassed together; which she seemed to wish with equal ardour. i then told\\r\\nher, now she was my wife, i thought proper to know her name, which i had\\r\\nnever before asked, for fear of giving uneasiness; for, as i added, i\\r\\ndid not doubt she had observed in my behaviour, ever since i first\\r\\nsaw her, a peculiar tenderness for her, and a sedulous concern not to\\r\\noffend, which had obliged me hitherto to stifle several questions i\\r\\nhad to ask her whenever they would be agreeable to her. she then bid me\\r\\nbegin; for as she was now my wife, whilst i was speaking it became her\\r\\nto be all attention, and to give me the utmost satisfaction she could in\\r\\nall i should require, as she herself should have so great an interest in\\r\\neverything for the future which would oblige me.\\r\\n\\r\\ncompliments (if, in compliance with old custom, i may call them so, for\\r\\nthey were by us delivered from the heart) being a little over on both\\r\\nsides, i first desired to know what name she went by before i found\\r\\nher: \"for,\" says i, \"having only hitherto called you madam, and my lady,\\r\\nbesides the future expression of my love to you in the word dear, i\\r\\nwould know your original name, that so i might join it with that tender\\r\\nepithet.\"--\"that you shall,\" says she, \"and also my family at another\\r\\nopportunity; but as my name will not take up long time to repeat at\\r\\npresent, it is youwarkee. and pray,\" says she, \"now gratify me with the\\r\\nknowledge of yours.\"--\"my dear youwarkee,\" says i, \"my name was peter\\r\\nwilkins when i heard it last; but that is so long ago, i had almost\\r\\nforgot it. and now,\" says i, \"there is another thing you can give me a\\r\\npleasure in.\"--\"you need, then, only mention it, my dear peter,\" says\\r\\nshe.--\"that is,\" says i, \"only to tell me if you did not, by some\\r\\naccident, fall from the top of the rock over my habitation, upon the\\r\\nroof of it, when i first took you in here; and whether you are of the\\r\\ncountry upon the rocks?\"--she, softly smiling, answered, \"my dear peter,\\r\\nyou run your questions too thick. as to my country, which is not on the\\r\\nrocks, as you suppose, but at a vast distance from hence, i shall leave\\r\\nthat till i may hereafter, at more leisure, speak of my family, as i\\r\\npromised you before; but as to how i came into this grotto, i knew not\\r\\nat first, but soon perceived your humanity had brought me in, to take\\r\\ncare of me, after a terrible fall i had; not from the rock, as you\\r\\nsuppose, for then i must not now have been living to enjoy you, but\\r\\nfrom a far less considerable height in the air. i\\'ll tell you how it\\r\\nhappened. a parcel of us young people were upon a merry _swangean_*\\r\\nround this _arkoe_,** which we usually divert ourselves with at set\\r\\ntimes of the year, chasing and pursuing one another, sometimes soaring\\r\\nto an extravagant height, and then shooting down again with surprising\\r\\nprecipitancy, till we even touch the trees; when of a sudden we mount\\r\\nagain and away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     * flight.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ** water surrounded with a wood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"i say, being of this party, and pursued by one of my comrades, i\\r\\ndescended down to the very trees, and she after me; but as i mounted,\\r\\nshe over-shooting me, brushed so stiffly against the upper part of\\r\\nmy _graundee_* that i lost my bearing; and being so near the branches\\r\\nbefore i could recover it again, i sunk into the tree, and rendered\\r\\nmy graundee useless to me; so that down i came, and that with so much\\r\\nforce, that i but just felt my fall, and lost my senses. whether i cried\\r\\nout or no upon my coming to the ground, i cannot say; but if i did, my\\r\\ncompanion was too far gone by that time to hear or take notice of me;\\r\\nas she, probably, in so swift a flight, saw not my fall. as to the\\r\\ncondition i was in, or what happened immediately afterwards, i must\\r\\nbe obliged to you for a relation of that; but one thing i was quickly\\r\\nsensible of, and never can forget, viz., that i owe my life to your care\\r\\nand kindness to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     * the covering and wings of skin they flew with.\\r\\n\\r\\ni told her she should have that part of her story from me another time.\\r\\n\"but,\" says i, \"there is something so amazing in these flights, or\\r\\nswangeans, as you call them, that i must, as the questions for this day,\\r\\nbeg you would let me know what is the method of them. what is the nature\\r\\nof your covering, which was at first such an obstacle to my wishes? how\\r\\nyou put it on? and how you use it in your swangean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"surely, my dearest peter,\" says she, \"but that i can deny you nothing,\\r\\nsince you are my _barkatt_* which you seem so passionately to desire,\\r\\nthe latter of your questions would not be answered, for it must put me\\r\\nto the blush. as to our method of flight, you saw somewhat of that last\\r\\nnight, though in a light hardly sufficient for you; and for the nature\\r\\nof my covering, you perceive that now; but to show you how it is put on,\\r\\nas you call it, i am afraid it will be necessary, as far as i can, to\\r\\nput it off, before i can make you comprehend that; which having done,\\r\\nthe whole will be no farther a mystery. but, not to be tedious, is it\\r\\nyour command that i uncover? lay that upon me, it shall be done.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     * husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nhere i was at a plunge whether to proceed or drop the question. thinks\\r\\ni, if my curiosity should be fatal to me, as i may see something i can\\r\\nnever bear hereafter, i am undone. she waits the command! why so? i know\\r\\nnot the consequence! what shall i do? at last, somewhat resolutely, i\\r\\nasked her whether her answer either way to my command would cause her to\\r\\nleave me, or me to love her less? she, seeing my hesitation, and\\r\\nperceiving the cause, was so pleased, that she cried out--\"no, my dear\\r\\npeter, not that, nor all the force on earth, shall ever part me from\\r\\nyou. but i conceive you are afraid you shall discover something in me\\r\\nyou may not like. i fear not that; but an immodest appearance before\\r\\nyou i cannot suffer myself to be guilty of, but under your own\\r\\ncommand.\"--\"my lovely youwarkee,\" says i, \"delay then my desires no\\r\\nlonger; and since you require a warrant from me, i do command you to do\\r\\nit\" immediately her graundee flew open (discovering her naked body just\\r\\nto the hip, and round the rim of her belly) and, expanding itself, was\\r\\nnear six feet wide. here my love and curiosity had a hard conflict; the\\r\\none to gain my attention to the graundee, and the other to retain my\\r\\neyes and thoughts on her lovely body, which i had never beheld so much\\r\\nof before. though i was very unwilling to keep her uncovered too long, i\\r\\ncould not easily dismiss so charming a sight i attentively viewed her\\r\\nlovely flesh, and examined the case that enshrined it; but as i shall\\r\\ngive you a full description of the graundee hereafter, in a more proper\\r\\nplace, i will mention it no farther here, than to tell you that when i\\r\\nhad narrowly surveyed the upper part of it, she in a moment contracted\\r\\nit round her so close that the nicest eye could not perceive the joining\\r\\nof the parts. \"indeed, my dear youwarkee,\" says i, \"you had the best of\\r\\nreasons for saying you was not fearful i should discover anything in you\\r\\ndispleasing; for if my bosom glowed with love before, you have now\\r\\ntherein raised an ardent flame, which neither time, nor aught else, will\\r\\never be able to extinguish. i now almost conceive how you fly; though\\r\\nyet i am at a loss to know how you extend and make use of the lower part\\r\\nof your graundee, which rises up and meets the upper; but i will rather\\r\\nguess at that by what i have seen, than raise the colour higher in those\\r\\nfair cheeks, which are, however, adorned with blushes.\" then running to\\r\\nher, and taking her in my arms, i called her the dearest gift of heaven;\\r\\nand left off further interrogatories till another opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xvii.\\r\\n\\r\\n     youwarkee cannot bear a strong light--wilkins makes her\\r\\n     spectacles, which help her--a description of them\\r\\n\\r\\nyouwarkee and i having no other company than one another\\'s, we talked\\r\\ntogether almost from morn to night, in order to learn each other\\'s\\r\\ndialect but how compilable soever she was in all other respects, i could\\r\\nnot persuade her to go out with me to fetch water, or to the lake, in\\r\\nthe day-time. it being now the light season, i wanted her to be more\\r\\nabroad; but she excused herself, telling me her people never came into\\r\\nthose luminous parts of the country during the false glare, as they\\r\\ncalled it, but kept altogether at home, where their light was more\\r\\nmoderate and steadier; and that the place where i resided was not\\r\\nfrequented by them for half the year, and at other times only upon\\r\\nparties of pleasure, it not being worth while to settle habitations\\r\\nwhere they could not abide always. she said normnbdsgrsutt was the\\r\\nfinest region in the world, where her king\\'s court was, and a vast\\r\\nkingdom. i asked her twice or thrice more to name the country to me,\\r\\nbut not all the art we could use, hers in dictating, and mine in\\r\\nendeavouring to pronounce it, would render me conqueror of that\\r\\nher monosyllable (for as such it sounded from her sweet lips); so i\\r\\nrelinquished the name to her, telling her whenever she had any more\\r\\noccasion to mention the place, i desired it might be under the style of\\r\\ndoorpt swangeanti, which she promised; but wondered, as she could speak\\r\\nthe other so glibly, as she called it, i could not do so too.\\r\\n\\r\\ni told her that the light of my native country was far stronger than any\\r\\ni had seen since my arrival at graundevolet (for that, i found by her,\\r\\nwas the name my dominions went by); and that we had a sun, or ball of\\r\\nfire, which rolled over our heads every day, with such a light, and such\\r\\na heat, that it would sometimes almost scorch one, it was so hot, and\\r\\nwas of such brightness that the eye could not look at it without danger\\r\\nof blindness. she was heartily glad, she said, she was not born in so\\r\\nwretched a land; and she did not believe there was any other so good\\r\\nas her own. i thought no benefit could arise from my combating these\\r\\ninnocent prejudices, so i let them alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nshe had often lamented to me the difference of our eyesight, and the\\r\\ntrouble it was to her that she could not at all times go about with me,\\r\\ntill it gave me a good deal of uneasiness to see her concern. at last i\\r\\ntold her, that though i believed it would be impossible to reduce my\\r\\nsight to the standard of hers, yet i was persuaded i could bring hers to\\r\\nbear the strongest light i had ever seen in this country. she was\\r\\nmightily pleased with the thought of that, and said she wished i might,\\r\\nfor she was sensible of no grief like being obliged to stay at home when\\r\\ni went abroad on my business, and was resolved to try my experiment if i\\r\\npleased, and in the meantime should heartily pray for the success. i hit\\r\\non the following invention.\\r\\n\\r\\ni rummaged over all my old things, and by good luck found an old\\r\\ncrape hatband. this i tried myself, single, before my own eyes, in the\\r\\nstrongest light we had; but believing i had not yet obscured it enough,\\r\\ni doubled it, and then thought it might do; but for fear it should not\\r\\ni trebled it, and then it seemed too dark for eyes like mine to discover\\r\\nobjects through it, and so i judged it would suit hers; for i was\\r\\ndetermined to produce something, if possible, that would do at first,\\r\\nwithout repetition of trial, which i thought would only deject her more,\\r\\nby making her look on the matter as impracticable. i now only wanted a\\r\\nproper method for fixing it on her, and this i thought would be easily\\r\\neffected, but had much more difficulty in it than i imagined. a first i\\r\\npurposed to tie the crape over her eyes, but trying it myself, i found\\r\\nit very rough and fretting: i then designed fixing it to an old crown of\\r\\na hat that held my fish-hooks and lines, and so let it hang down before\\r\\nher face; but that also had its inconveniences, as it would slap\\r\\nher eyes in windy weather, and would be not only useless, but very\\r\\ntroublesome in flight; so that i was scarce ever more puzzled before. at\\r\\nlast i thought of a method that answered exceedingly well, the hint\\r\\nof which i took from somewhat i had seen with my master when i was at\\r\\nschool, which he called goggles, and which he used to tie round his\\r\\nhead to screen his eyes in riding. the thing i made upon that plan was\\r\\ncomposed of old hat, pieces of rams-horn, and the above-mentioned crape.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen i had finished the whole apparatus, i tried it first upon myself,\\r\\nand finding great reason to believe it would perfectly answer the\\r\\nintention, i ran directly to youwarkee. \"come,\" says i, \"my dear, will\\r\\nyou go with me to the water-rill; for i must fetch some this morning?\"\\r\\nshe shook her head, and, with tears in her eyes, wished she could.\\r\\n\"but,\" says she, \"let me see how light it is abroad.\"--\"no,\" says i, \"my\\r\\nlove, you must not look out till you go.\"--\"indeed,\" says she, \"if it\\r\\ndid not affect my eyes and head you should not ask me twice.\"--\"well,\"\\r\\nsays i, \"my youwarkee, i am now come to take you with me; and that you\\r\\nmay not suffer by it, turn about, and let me apply the remedy i told\\r\\nyou of for your sight\" she wanted much to see first what it was, but i\\r\\nbegged her to forbear till she tried whether it would be useful or not\\r\\nshe told me she would absolutely submit to my direction, so i adjusted\\r\\nthe thing to her head. \"now,\" says i, \"you have it on, let us go out\\r\\nand try it, and let me know the moment you find the light offensive, and\\r\\ntake particular notice how you are affected.\" hereupon away we marched,\\r\\nand i heard no complaint in all our walk to the lake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"now, my dear youwarkee,\" says i, when we got there, \"what do you think\\r\\nof my contrivance? can you see at all?\"--\"yes, very well,\" says she.\\r\\n\"but, my dear peter, you have taken the advantage of the twilight, i\\r\\nknow, to deceive me; and i had rather have stayed at home than have\\r\\nsubjected you to return in the night for the sake of my company.\" i then\\r\\nassured her it was mid-day, and no later, which pleased her mightily;\\r\\nand, to satisfy her, i untied the string behind, and just let her be\\r\\nconvinced it was so. when i had fixed the shade on her head again, she\\r\\nput up her hands and felt the several materials of which it consisted;\\r\\nand after expressing her admiration of it, \"so, my dear peter,\" says\\r\\nshe, \"you have now encumbered yourself with a wife indeed, for since\\r\\ni can come abroad in a glaring light with so much ease, you will never\\r\\nhenceforward be without my company.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nyouwarkee being thus in spirits, we launched the boat, watered, took a\\r\\ndraught of fish, and returned; passing the night at home, in talking of\\r\\nthe spectacles (for that was the name i told her they must go by) and\\r\\nof the fishing, for that exercise delighted her to a great degree. but,\\r\\nabove all, the spectacles were her chief theme; she handled them and\\r\\nlooked at them again and again, and asked several rational questions\\r\\nabout them; as, how they could have that effect on her eyes, enabling\\r\\nher to see, and the like. she ventured out with them next day by\\r\\nherself; and, as she threatened, was as good as her word, for she\\r\\nscarcely afterwards let me go abroad by myself, but accompanied me\\r\\neverywhere freely, and with delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xviii.\\r\\n\\r\\n     youwarkee with child--their stock of provisions--no beast or\\r\\n     fish in youwarkeis country--the voices again--her reason for\\r\\n     not seeing those who uttered them--she bears a son--a hard\\r\\n     speech in her lying-in--divers birds appear--their eggs\\r\\n     gathered--how wilkits kept account of time\\r\\n\\r\\nabout three months after we were married, as we called it, youwarkee\\r\\ntold me she believed she was breeding, and i was mightily pleased with\\r\\nit, for though i had had two children before by patty, yet i had never\\r\\nseen either of them, so that i longed to be a father. i sometimes amused\\r\\nmyself with whimsical conjectures, as, whether the child would have a\\r\\ngraundee or not; which of us it would be most like; how we should do\\r\\nwithout a midwife; and what must become of the infant, as we had not\\r\\nmilk, in case youwarkee could not suckle it. indeed, i had leisure\\r\\nenough for indulging such reveries; for, having laid in our winter\\r\\nstores, my wife and i had nothing to do but enjoy ourselves over a good\\r\\nfire, prattling and toying together, making as good cheer as we could;\\r\\nand truly that was none of the worst, for we had as fine bread as need\\r\\nto be eaten; we had pears preserved; all sorts of dried fish; and once\\r\\na fortnight, for two or three days together, had fresh fish; we had\\r\\nvinegar, and a biting herb which i had found, for pepper; and several\\r\\nsorts of nuts; so there was no want.\\r\\n\\r\\nit was at this time, after my return from watering one day, where\\r\\nyouwarkee had been with me, that, having taken several fish, and amongst\\r\\nthem some i had not before seen, i asked her, as we were preparing and\\r\\nsalting some of them, how they managed fish in her country, and what\\r\\nvariety they had of them there. she told me she neither ever saw nor\\r\\nheard of a fish in her life till she came to me. \"how!\" says i, \"no fish\\r\\namongst you? why, you want one of the greatest dainties that can be\\r\\nset upon a table. do you wholly eat flesh,\" says i, \"at doorpt\\r\\nswangeanti?\"--\"flesh,\" says she laughingly, \"of what?\"--\"nay,\" says\\r\\ni, \"you know best what the beasts of your own country are. we have in\\r\\nengland, where i was born and bred, oxen, very large hogs, sheep, lambs,\\r\\nand calves; these make our ordinary dishes: then we have deer, hares,\\r\\nrabbits, and these are reckoned dainties; besides numberless kinds of\\r\\npoultry, and fish without stint\"--\"i never heard of any of these things\\r\\nin my life,\" says youwarkee, \"nor did i ever eat anything but fruits and\\r\\nherbs, and what is made from them, at normnbdsgrsutt.\"--\"you will speak\\r\\nthat crabbed word,\" says i, \"again.\"--\"i beg your pardon, my dear,\"\\r\\nsays she; \"at doorpt swangeanti, i say; nor i, nor any one else, to my\\r\\nknowledge, ever ate any such thing; but seeing you eat fish, as you\\r\\ncall them, i made no scruple of doing so too, and like them very well,\\r\\nespecially the salted ones, for i never tasted what you call salt\\r\\nneither till i came here.\"--\"i cannot think,\" says i, \"what sort of a\\r\\ncountry yours is, or how you all live there.\"--\"oh,\" says she, \"there\\r\\nis no want; i wish you and i were there.\" i was afraid i had talked too\\r\\nmuch of her country already, so we called a new cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nsoon after winter had set in, as we were in bed one night, i heard\\r\\nthe voices again; and though my wife had told me of her countryfolk\\'s\\r\\nswangeans in that place, i, being frighted a little, waked her; and she\\r\\nhearing them too, cried out, \"there they are! it is ten to one but\\r\\nmy sister or some of our family are there. hark! i believe i hear\\r\\nher voice.\" i myself hearkened very attentively; and by this time\\r\\nunderstanding a great deal of their language, i not only could\\r\\ndistinguish different speakers, but knew the meaning of several of the\\r\\nwords they pronounced.\\r\\n\\r\\ni would have had youwarkee have gotten up and called to them. \"not for\\r\\nthe world,\" says she; \"have you a mind to part with me? though i have no\\r\\nintent to leave you, as i am with child, if they should try to force me\\r\\naway without my consent, i may receive some injury, to the danger of my\\r\\nown life, or at least of the child\\'s.\" this reason perfectly satisfying\\r\\nme, endeared the loving creature to me ten times more, if possible, than\\r\\never.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe next summer brought me a yawm,* as fair as alabaster.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * man-child.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy wife was delivered without the usual assistance, and had as\\r\\nfavourable a labour as could be. the first thing i did, after giving her\\r\\nsome fish-soup, made as skilfully as i was able, and a little cordial,\\r\\nwas to see if my yawm had the graundee or not. finding it had--\"so,\"\\r\\nsays i to youwarkee, \"you have brought me a legitimate heir to my\\r\\ndominions, whose title sure cannot be disputed, being one of you.\"\\r\\nthough i spoke this with as much pleasure, and in as endearing a way as\\r\\never i spoke in my life, and quite innocently, the poor youwarkee burst\\r\\ninto tears to such excess there was no pacifying her. i asked her\\r\\nthe reason of her grief, begged and entreated her to let me know what\\r\\ndisturbed her, but all in vain; till, seeing me in a violent passion,\\r\\nsuch as i had never before appeared to be in, she told me she was very\\r\\nsorry i should question her fidelity to me. she surprised me in saying\\r\\nthis, as i never had any such apprehension. \"no, my dearest wife,\" says\\r\\ni, \"i never had any such suspicion as you charge me with, i can safely\\r\\naffirm; nor can i comprehend your meaning by imputing such a thing to\\r\\nme.\"--\"oh!\" says she, \"i am sure you have no cause for it; but you said\\r\\nthe poor child was one of us; as much as to intimate that had it been\\r\\nyour own, it would have been born as you were, without the graundee,\\r\\nwhich thought i cannot bear, and if you continue to think so it must end\\r\\nme; therefore take away my life now, rather than let me live to see my\\r\\nfarther misery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\ni was heartily sorry for what i had said, when i saw the effects of it,\\r\\nthough i did not imagine it could have been perverted to such a contrary\\r\\nmeaning. but considering her to be the faithful-lest and most loving\\r\\ncreature upon earth, and that true love cannot bear anything\\r\\nthat touches upon or can be applied (though with ever so forced a\\r\\nconstruction) to an opprobrious or contemptuous meaning, i attributed\\r\\nher groundless resentment to her excess of fondness only for me; and\\r\\nfalling upon the bed by her, and bathing her face in my tears, i assured\\r\\nher the interpretation she had put on my words was altogether foreign\\r\\nfrom the view they were spoken with; professing to her that i never had,\\r\\nnor ever could have, the least cause of jealousy. on my confirming this\\r\\nabsolute confidence in her virtue by the strongest asseverations, she\\r\\ngrew fully convinced of her error, and acknowledged she had been too\\r\\nrash in censuring me; and growing pleased at my fresh professions of\\r\\nlove to her, we presently were reconciled, and became again very good\\r\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen youwarkee had gathered strength again, she proved an excellent\\r\\nnurse to my pedro (for that was the name i gave him), so that he soon\\r\\ngrew a charming child, able to go in his twelvemonth, and spoke in his\\r\\ntwentieth. this and two other lovely boys i had by her in three years,\\r\\nevery one of which she brought up with the breast, and they thrived\\r\\ndelicately.\\r\\n\\r\\ni don\\'t mention the little intervening occurrences which happened\\r\\nduring this period; they consisted chiefly of the old rota of fishing,\\r\\nwatering, providing in the summer for the winter, and in managing my\\r\\nsalt-work; which altogether kept me at full employment, comfortably to\\r\\nmaintain an increasing family.\\r\\n\\r\\nin this time i had found out several new sorts of eatables. i had\\r\\nobserved, as i said before, abundance of birds about the wood and lake\\r\\nin the summer months. these, by firing at them two or three times on my\\r\\nfirst coming, i had almost caused to desert my dominions. but as i had\\r\\nfor the last two or three years given no disturbance at all to them,\\r\\nthey were now in as great plenty as ever; and i made great profit of\\r\\nthem by the peace they enjoyed; and yet my table never wanted a supply,\\r\\nfresh in the summer, or salted and pickled in winter.\\r\\n\\r\\ni took notice it was about october these birds used to come; and most of\\r\\nthe month of november they were busy in laying their eggs, which i used\\r\\nat that time to find in great plenty along the banks of the lake in the\\r\\nreeds, and made great collections of them; i used also to find a great\\r\\nmany in the woods amongst the shrubs and underwood. these furnished our\\r\\ntable various ways; for with my cream-cheese flour, and a little mixture\\r\\nof ram\\'s-horn juice, i had taught my wife to make excellent puddings of\\r\\nthem; abundance of them also we ate boiled or fried alone, and often as\\r\\nsauce to our fish. as for the birds themselves, having long omitted to\\r\\nfire at them, i had an effectual means of taking them otherwise by nets,\\r\\nwhich i set between the trees, and also very large pitfall nets, with\\r\\nwhich i used to catch all sorts, even from the size of a thrush to that\\r\\nof a turkey. but as i shall say more of these when i come to speak of my\\r\\nward by and by, and of my poultry, i shall omit any further mention of\\r\\nthem here.\\r\\n\\r\\nyou may perhaps wonder how i could keep an account of my time so\\r\\nprecisely, as to talk of the particular months. i will tell you. at my\\r\\ncoming from america, i was then exact; for we set sail the fourteenth of\\r\\nnovember, and struck the first or second day of february. so far i kept\\r\\nperfect reckoning; but after that i was not so exact, though i kept it\\r\\nas well as my perplexity would admit even then, till the days shortening\\r\\nupon me, prevented it.\\r\\n\\r\\nhereupon i set about making a year for myself. i found the duration of\\r\\nthe comparative darkness, or what might with me be termed night, in the\\r\\ncourse of the twenty-four hours, or day, gradually increased for six\\r\\nmonths; after which it decreased reciprocally for an equal time, and\\r\\nthe lighter part of the day took its turn, as in our parts of the world,\\r\\nonly inversely: so that as the light\\'s decrease became sensible about\\r\\nthe middle of march, it was at the greatest pitch the latter end of\\r\\naugust, or beginning of september; and from thence, on the contrary,\\r\\nwent on decreasing to the close of february, when i had the longest\\r\\nportion of light. hereupon, dividing my year into two seasons only, i\\r\\nbegan the winter half in march, and the summer half in september. thus\\r\\nmy winter was the spring and summer quarters in europe, and my summer\\r\\nthose of our autumn and winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nfrom my settling this matter, i kept little account of days or weeks,\\r\\nbut only reckoned my time by summer and winter, so that i am pretty\\r\\nright as to the revolutions of these; though the years, as to their\\r\\nnotation, i kept no account of, nor do i know what year of the lord it\\r\\nnow is.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xix.\\r\\n\\r\\n     wilkins\\'s concern about clothing for pedro, his eldest son--\\r\\n     his discourse with his wife about the ship--her flight to\\r\\n     it--his melancholy reflections till her return--an account\\r\\n     of what she had done, and of what she brought--she clothes\\r\\n     her children, and takes a second flight\\r\\n\\r\\nas my boy pedro grew up, though, as i said before, he had the graundee,\\r\\nyet it was of less dimensions than it ought to have been to be useful to\\r\\nhim, so that it was visible he could never fly; for it would scarce meet\\r\\nbefore, whereas it ought to have reached from side to side both ways.\\r\\nthis pleased my wife to the heart; for now she was sure, whatever i\\r\\nhad done before, i could not suspect her. be that as it will, the boy\\'s\\r\\ngraundee not being a sufficient vestment for him, it became necessary he\\r\\nshould be clothed.\\r\\n\\r\\ni turned over my hoard, but could find nothing that would do; or, at\\r\\nleast, that we knew how to fit him with. i had described my own country\\r\\nvest for lads to youwarkee, and she formed a tolerable idea of it, but\\r\\nwe had no tackle to alter anything with. \"oh, my dear,\" says i, \"had i\\r\\nbut been born with the graundee, i need not be now racking my brains to\\r\\nget my child clothes.\"--\"what do you mean by that?\" says she.--\"why,\"\\r\\nsays i, \"i would have flown to my ship (for i had long before related\\r\\nto her all my sea adventures, till the vessel\\'s coming to the magnetical\\r\\nrock), and have brought some such things from thence, as you, not\\r\\nwanting them in this country, can have no notion of.\" she seemed mighty\\r\\ninquisitive to understand how a ship was made, what it was most like to,\\r\\nhow a person who never saw one might know it only by the description,\\r\\nand how one might get into it; with abundance of the like questions.\\r\\nshe then inquired what sort of things those needles and several other\\r\\nutensils were, which i had at times been speaking of; and in what\\r\\npart of a ship they usually kept such articles. and i, to gratify her\\r\\ncuriosity, as i perceived she took a pleasure in hearing me, answered\\r\\nall her questions to a scruple; not then conceiving the secret purpose\\r\\nof all this inquisitiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\nabout two days after this, having been out two or three hours in the\\r\\nmorning, to cut wood, at coming home i found pedro crying, ready\\r\\nto break his heart, and his little brother tommy hanging to him and\\r\\ncrawling about the floor after him: the youngest pretty baby was fast\\r\\nasleep upon one of the beast-fish skins, in a corner of the room. i\\r\\nasked pedro for his mother; but the poor infant had nothing farther to\\r\\nsay to the matter, than \"mammy run away, i cry! mammy run away, i\\r\\ncry!\" i wondered where she was gone, never before missing her from our\\r\\nhabitation. however, i waited patiently till bed-time, but no wife.\\r\\ni grew very uneasy then; yet, as my children were tired and sleepy, i\\r\\nthought i had best go to bed with them, and make quiet; so, giving all\\r\\nthree their suppers, we lay down together. they slept; but my mind was\\r\\ntoo full to permit the closure of my eyes. a thousand different chimeras\\r\\nswam in my imagination relating to my wife. one while i fancied her\\r\\ncarried away by her kinsfolks; then, that she was gone of her own accord\\r\\nto make peace with her father. but that thought would not fix, being put\\r\\naside by her constant tenderness to her children and regard to me, whom\\r\\ni was sure she would not have left without notice. \"but alas!\" says i,\\r\\n\"she may even now be near me, but taken so ill she cannot get home, or\\r\\nshe may have died suddenly in the wood.\" i lay tumbling and tossing in\\r\\ngreat anxiety, not able to find out any excusable occasion she could\\r\\nhave of so long absence. and then, thinks i, if she should either be\\r\\ndead, or have quite left me, which will be of equally bad consequence\\r\\nto me, what can i do with three poor helpless infants? if they were a\\r\\nlittle more grown up, they might be helpful to me and to each other;\\r\\nbut at their age how shall i ever rear them without the tenderness of\\r\\na mother? and to see them pine away before my face, and not know how to\\r\\nhelp them, will distract me.\\r\\n\\r\\nfinding i could neither sleep nor lie still, i rose, intending to search\\r\\nall the woods about, and call to her, that if any accident had prevented\\r\\nsight of her she might at least hear me. but upon opening the door, and\\r\\njust stepping out, how agreeably was i surprised to meet her coming in,\\r\\nwith something on her arm. \"my dear youwarkee,\" says i, \"where have you\\r\\nbeen? what has befallen you to keep you out so long? the poor children\\r\\nhave been at their wits\\' end to find you; and i, my dear, have been\\r\\ninconsolable, and was now, almost distracted, coming in search of you.\"\\r\\nyouwarkee looked very blank, to think what concern she had given me and\\r\\nthe children. \"my dearest peter,\" says she, kissing me, \"pray forgive\\r\\nme the only thing i have ever done to offend you, and the last cause\\r\\nyou shall ever have, by my good will, to complain of me; but walk within\\r\\ndoors, and i will give you a farther account of my absence. don\\'t you\\r\\nremember what delight i took the other day to hear you talk of your\\r\\nship?\"--\"yes,\" says i, \"you did so; but what of that?\"--\"nay, pray,\"\\r\\nsays she, \"forgive me, for i have been to see it.\"--\"that\\'s impossible,\"\\r\\nsays i; and truly this was the first time i ever thought she went about\\r\\nto deceive me.--\"i do assure you,\" says she, \"i have; and a wonderful\\r\\nthing it is! but if you distrust me, and what i say, i have brought\\r\\nproof of it; step out with me to the verge of the wood, and satisfy\\r\\nyourself.\"--\"but pray,\" says i, \"who presented you with this upon your\\r\\narm?\"--\"i vow,\" says she, \"i had forgot this: yes, this will, i believe,\\r\\nconfirm to you what i have said.\"--i turned it over and over; and\\r\\nlooking wistfully upon her, says i, \"this waistcoat, indeed, is the very\\r\\nfellow to one that lay in the captain\\'s locker in the cabin\"--\"say not\\r\\nthe very fellow,\" says she, \"but rather say the very same, for i\\'ll\\r\\nassure you it is so; and had you been with me, we might have got so many\\r\\nthings for ourselves and the children, we should never have wanted\\r\\nmore, though we had lived these hundred years; but as it is, i have left\\r\\nsomething without the wood for you to bring up.\" when we had our talk\\r\\nout, she, hearing the children stir, took them up, and was going, as she\\r\\nalways did, to get their breakfasts. \"hold,\" says i, \"this journey must\\r\\nhave fatigued you too much already; lay yourself to rest, and leave\\r\\neverything else to me.\"--\"my dear,\" says she, \"you seem to think this\\r\\nflight tiresome, but you are mistaken; i am more weary with walking to\\r\\nthe lake and back again, than with all the rest. oh,\" says she, \"if you\\r\\nhad but the graundee, flying would rest you, after the greatest labour;\\r\\nfor the parts which are moved with exercise on the earth, are all at\\r\\nrest in flight; as, on the contrary, the parts used in flight are when\\r\\non earthly travel. the whole trouble of flight is in mounting from\\r\\nthe plain ground; but when once you are upon the graundee at a proper\\r\\nheight, all the rest is play, a mere trifle; you need only think of your\\r\\nway, and incline to it, your graundee directs you as readily as your\\r\\nfeet obey you on the ground, without thinking of every step you take; it\\r\\ndoes not require labour, as your boat does, to keep you a-going.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nafter we had composed ourselves, we walked to the verge of the wood, to\\r\\nsee what cargo my wife had brought from the ship. i was astonished at\\r\\nthe bulk of it; and seeing, by the outside, it consisted of clothes, i\\r\\ntook it with much ado upon my shoulders and carried it home. but upon\\r\\nopening it, i found far more treasure than i could have imagined; for\\r\\nthere was a hammer, a great many spikes and nails, three spoons, about\\r\\nfive plates of pewter, four knives and a fork, a small china punchbowl,\\r\\ntwo chocolate cups, a paper of needles, and several of pins, a parcel\\r\\nof coarse thread, a pair of shoes, and abundance of such other things\\r\\nas she had heard me wish for and describe; besides as much linen and\\r\\nwoollen, of one sort or another, as made a good package for all the\\r\\nother things; with a great tin porridge-pot, of about two gallons, tied\\r\\nto the outside; and all these as nicely stowed as if she had been bred a\\r\\npacker.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen i had viewed the bundle, and poised the weight, \"how was it\\r\\npossible, my dear you-warkee,\" said i, \"for you to bring all this?\\r\\nyou could never carry them in your hands.\"--\"no, no,\" replied she, \"i\\r\\ncarried them on my back.\"--\"is it possible,\" says i, \"for your graundee\\r\\nto bear yourself and all this weight too in the air, and to such a\\r\\nheight as the top of these rocks?\"--\"you will always,\" replies she,\\r\\n\"make the height a part of your difficulty in flying; but you are\\r\\ndeceived, for as the first stroke (i have heard you say often) in\\r\\nfighting is half the battle, so it is in flying; get but once fairly on\\r\\nthe wind, nothing can hurt you afterwards. my method, let me tell you,\\r\\nwas this; i climbed to the highest part of the ship, where i could stand\\r\\nclear, having first put up my burden, which you have there; and then\\r\\ngetting that on my back near my shoulders, i took the two cords you see\\r\\nhang loose to it in my two hands, and extending my graundee, leaped off\\r\\nflatwise with my face towards the water; when instantly playing two or\\r\\nthree good strokes with my graundee, i was out of danger; now, if i\\r\\nhad found the bundle too heavy to make my first strokes with, i should\\r\\ndirectly have turned on my back, dropped my bundle, and floated in my\\r\\ngraundee to the ship again, as you once saw me float on the lake.\" says\\r\\ni, \"you must have flown a prodigious distance to the lake, for i was\\r\\nseveral days sailing, i believe three weeks, from my ship, before i\\r\\nreached the gulf; and after that could be little less than five weeks\\r\\n(as i accounted for it), and at a great rate of sailing too under the\\r\\nrock, before i reached the lake; so that the ship must be a monstrous\\r\\nway off.\" \"no, no,\" says she, \"your ship lies but over yon cliff, that\\r\\nrises as it were with two points; and as to the rock itself, it is not\\r\\nbroader than our lake is long; but what made you so tedious in your\\r\\npassage was many of the windings and turnings in the cavern returning\\r\\nin to themselves again; so that you might have gone round and round\\r\\ntill this time, if the tide had not luckily struck you into the direct\\r\\npassage: this,\" says she, \"i have heard from some of my countrymen, who\\r\\nhave flown up it, but could never get quite through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"i wish with all my heart,\" says i, \"fortune had brought me first to\\r\\nlight in this country; or (but for your sake i could almost say) had\\r\\nnever brought me into it at all; for to be a creature of the\\r\\nleast significancy, of the whole race but one, is a melancholy\\r\\ncircumstance.\"--\"fear not,\" says she, \"my love, for you have a wife will\\r\\nhazard all for you, though you are restrained; and as my inclinations\\r\\nand affections are so much yours, that i need but know your desires\\r\\nto execute them as far as my power extends, surely you, who can act by\\r\\nanother, may be content to forego the trouble of your own performance. i\\r\\nperceive, indeed,\" continued she, \"you want mightily to go to your ship,\\r\\nand are more uneasy now you know it is safe than you was before; but\\r\\nthat being past my skill to assist you in, if you will command your\\r\\ndeputy to go backwards and forwards in your stead, i am ready to obey\\r\\nyou.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthus ended our conversation about the ship for that time. but it left\\r\\nnot my mind so soon; for a stronger hankering after it pursued me now\\r\\nthan ever since my wife\\'s flight, but to no purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe sat us down and sorted out our cargo, piece by piece; and having\\r\\nfound several things proper for the children, my wife longed to enter\\r\\nupon some piece of work towards clothing pedro in the manner she\\r\\nhad heard me talk of, and laid hard at me to show her the use of the\\r\\nneedles, thread, and other things she had brought. indeed i must say\\r\\nshe proved very tractable; and from the little instruction i was able to\\r\\ngive her, soon out-wrought my knowledge; for i could only show her that\\r\\nthe thread went through the needle, and both through the cloth to hold\\r\\nit together; but for anything else i was as ignorant as she. in much\\r\\nless time than i could have imagined, she had clothed my son pedro, and\\r\\nhad made a sort of mantle for the youngest. but now seeing us so smart\\r\\n(for i took upon me sometimes to wear the green waistcoat she had\\r\\nbrought under my dirty jacket), she began to be ashamed of herself, as\\r\\nshe said, in our fine company; and afterwards (as i shall soon acquaint\\r\\nyou) got into our fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nseeing the advantages her flight to the ship, and that so many\\r\\nconveniences arose from it, she was frequently at me to let her go\\r\\nagain. i should as much have wished for another return of goods as she,\\r\\nbut i could by no means think of parting with my factor; for i knew her\\r\\neagerness to please me, and that she would stick at nothing to perform\\r\\nit. and, thinks i, should any accident happen to her, by over-loading or\\r\\notherwise, and i should lose her, all the other commodities of the\\r\\nwhole world put together would not compensate her loss. but as she so\\r\\nearnestly desired it, and assured me she would run no hazards, i was\\r\\nprevailed on at length, by her incessant importunities, to let her go;\\r\\nthough under certain restrictions which she promised me to comply with.\\r\\nas first, i insisted upon it that she should take a tour quite round\\r\\nthe rock, setting out the same way i had last gone with my boat; and, if\\r\\npossible, find out the gulf, which i told her she could not mistake,\\r\\nby reason of the noise the fall of the water made; and desired her to\\r\\nremark the place, so as i might know within-side where it was without.\\r\\nand then i told her she might review and search every hole in the ship\\r\\nas she pleased; and if there were any small things she had a mind to\\r\\nbring from it, she was welcome, provided the bundle she should make up\\r\\nwas not above a fourth part either of the bulk or weight of the last.\\r\\nall which she having engaged punctually to observe, she bade me not\\r\\nexpect her till i saw her, and she would return as soon as possible. i\\r\\nthen went with her to the confines of the wood (for i told her i desired\\r\\nto see her mount), and she, after we had embraced, bidding me to stand\\r\\nbehind her, took her flight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xx.\\r\\n\\r\\n     the author observes her flight--a description of a glumm\\r\\n     in the graundee--she finds out the gulf not far from the\\r\\n     ship--brings home more goods--makes her a gown by her\\r\\n     husband\\'s instruction\\r\\n\\r\\ni had ever since our marriage been desirous of seeing youwarkee fly;\\r\\nbut this was the first opportunity i had of it; and indeed the sight was\\r\\nworthy of all the attention i paid it; for i desired her slowly to put\\r\\nherself in proper order for it, that i might make my observation\\r\\nthe more accurately; and shall now give you an account of the whole\\r\\napparatus, though several parts of the description were taken from\\r\\nsubsequent views; for it would have been impossible to have made just\\r\\nremarks of everything at that once, especially as i only viewed her back\\r\\nparts then.\\r\\n\\r\\ni told you before, i had seen her graundee open, and quite extended as\\r\\nlow as her middle; but that being in the grotto by lamplight, i could\\r\\nnot take so just a survey as now, when the sort of light we ever had was\\r\\nat the brightest.\\r\\n\\r\\nshe first threw up two long branches or ribs of the whalebone, as\\r\\ni called it before (and indeed for several of its properties, as\\r\\ntoughness, elasticity, and pliableness, nothing i have ever seen can so\\r\\njustly be compared to it), which were jointed behind to the upper bone\\r\\nof the spine, and which, when not extended, lie bent over the shoulders\\r\\non each side of the neck forwards, from whence, by nearer and nearer\\r\\napproaches, they just meet at the lower rim of the belly in a sort\\r\\nof point; but when extended, they stand their whole length above the\\r\\nshoulders, not perpendicularly, but spreading outwards, with a web of\\r\\nthe softest and most pliable and springy membrane that can be imagined,\\r\\nin the interstice between them, reaching from their root or joint on the\\r\\nback up above the hinder part of the head, and near half-way their own\\r\\nlength; but when closed, the membrane falls down in the middle upon the\\r\\nneck, like a handkerchief. there are also two other ribs rising as it\\r\\nwere from the same root, which, when open, run horizontally, but not so\\r\\nlong as the others. these are filled up in the interstice between them\\r\\nand the upper ones with the same membrane; and on the lower side of\\r\\nthis is also a deep flap of the membrane, so that the arms can be either\\r\\nabove or below it in flight, and are always above it when closed. this\\r\\nlast rib, when shut, flaps under the upper one, and also falls down with\\r\\nit before to the waist, but is not joined to the ribs below. along the\\r\\nwhole spine-bone runs a strong, flat, broad, grisly cartilage, to which\\r\\nare joined several other of these ribs; all which open horizontally, and\\r\\nare filled in the interstices with the above membrane, and are jointed\\r\\nto the ribs of the person just where the plane of the back begins to\\r\\nturn towards the breast and belly; and, when shut, wrap the body round\\r\\nto the joints on the contrary side, folding neatly one side over the\\r\\nother. at the lower spine are two more ribs, extended horizontally when\\r\\nopen, jointed again to the hips, and long enough to meet the joint on\\r\\nthe contrary side cross the belly; and from the hip-joint, which is on\\r\\nthe outermost edge of the hip-bone, runs a pliable cartilage quite down\\r\\nthe outside of the thigh and leg to the ankle; from which there branch\\r\\nout divers other ribs horizontally also when open, but when closed, they\\r\\nencompass the whole thigh and leg, rolling inwards cross the back of\\r\\nthe leg and thigh till they reach and just cover the cartilage. the\\r\\ninterstices of these are also filled up with the same membrane. from the\\r\\ntwo ribs which join to the lower spine-bone, there hangs down a sort\\r\\nof short apron, very full of plaits, from hip-joint to hip-joint, and\\r\\nreaches below the buttocks, half-way or more to the hams. this has also\\r\\nseveral small limber ribs in it. just upon the lower spine-joint, and\\r\\nabove the apron, as i call it, there are two other long branches, which,\\r\\nwhen close, extend upon the back from the point they join at below to\\r\\nthe shoulders, where each rib has a clasper, which reaching over the\\r\\nshoulders, just under the fold of the uppermost branch or ribs, hold\\r\\nup the two ribs flat to the back like a v, the interstices of which are\\r\\nalso filled up with the aforesaid membrane. this last piece, in flight,\\r\\nfalls down almost to the ankles, where the two claspers lapping under\\r\\neach leg within-side, hold it very fast; and then also the short apron\\r\\nis drawn up by-the strength of the ribs in it, between the thighs\\r\\nforward, and covers the pudenda and groin as far as the rim of the\\r\\nbelly. the whole arms are covered also from the shoulders to the wrist\\r\\nwith the same delicate membrane, fastened to ribs of proportionable\\r\\ndimensions, and jointed to a cartilage on the outside in the same manner\\r\\nas on the legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is very surprising to feel the difference of these ribs when open and\\r\\nwhen closed; for, closed, they are as pliable as the finest whalebone,\\r\\nor more so, but when extended, are as strong and stiff as a bone. they\\r\\nare tapering from the roots, and are broader or narrower as best suits\\r\\nthe places they occupy, and the stress they are put to, up to their\\r\\npoints, which are almost as small as a hair. the membrane between them\\r\\nis the most elastic thing i ever met with, occupying no more space, when\\r\\nthe ribs are closed, than just from rib to rib, as flat and smooth\\r\\nas possible; but when extended in some postures, will dilate itself\\r\\nsurprisingly. this will be better comprehend by the plates, where you\\r\\nwill see several figures of glumms and gawrys in different attitudes,\\r\\nthan can be expressed by words.\\r\\n\\r\\nas soon as my wife had expanded the whole graundee, being upon plain\\r\\nground, she stooped forward, moving with a heavy wriggling motion at\\r\\nfirst, which put me into some pain for her; but after a few strokes,\\r\\nbeginning to rise a little, she cut through the air like lightning, and\\r\\nwas soon over the edge of the rock and out of my sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is the most amazing thing in the world to observe the large expansion\\r\\nof this graundee when open; and when closed (as it all is in a moment\\r\\nupon the party\\'s descent) to see it sit so close and compact to the\\r\\nbody, as no tailor can come up to it; and then the several ribs lie so\\r\\njustly disposed in the several parts, that instead of being, as one\\r\\nwould imagine, a disadvantage to the shape, they make the body and limbs\\r\\nlook extremely elegant; and by the different adjustment of their lines\\r\\non the body and limbs, the whole, to my fancy, somewhat resembles the\\r\\ndress of the old roman warriors in their buskins; and, to appearance,\\r\\nseems much more noble than any fictitious garb i ever saw, or can frame\\r\\na notion of to myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nthough these people, in height, shape, and limb, very much resemble the\\r\\neuropeans, there is yet this difference, that their bodies are rather\\r\\nbroader and flatter, and their limbs, though as long and well shaped,\\r\\nare seldom as thick as ours. and this i observed generally in all i saw\\r\\nof them during a long time among them afterwards; but their skin, for\\r\\nbeauty and fairness, exceeds ours very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy wife having now taken her second flight, i went home, and never left\\r\\nmy children till her return; this was three days after our parting. i\\r\\nwas in bed with my little ones when she knocked at the door. i soon let\\r\\nher in, and we received each other with a glowing welcome. the news she\\r\\nbrought me was very agreeable. she told me she first went and pried into\\r\\nevery nook in the ship, where she had seen such things, could we get at\\r\\nthem, as would make us very happy. then she set out the way i told her\\r\\nto go, in order to find the gulf. she was much afraid she should not\\r\\nhave discovered it, though she flew very slow, that she might be sure\\r\\nto hear the waterfall and not over-shoot it. it was long ere she came\\r\\nat it; but when she did, she perceived she might have spared most of her\\r\\ntrouble, had she set out the other way; for, after she had flown almost\\r\\nround the island, and not before, she began to hear the fall, and upon\\r\\ncoming up to it, found it to be not above six minutes\\' flight from the\\r\\nship. she said the entrance was very narrow, and, she thought, lower\\r\\nthan i represented it; for she could scarce discern any space between\\r\\nthe surface of the water and the arch-way of the rock. i told her that\\r\\nmight happen from the rise or fall of the sea itself. but i was glad to\\r\\nhear the ship was no farther from the gulf; for my head was never free\\r\\nfrom the thoughts of my ship and cargo. she then told me she had left\\r\\na small bundle for me without the wood, and went to look after her\\r\\nchildren. i brought up the bundle, and though it was not near so large\\r\\nas the other, i found several useful things in it, wrapped up in four\\r\\nor five yards of dark blue woollen cloth, which i knew no name for, but\\r\\nwhich was thin and light, and about a yard wide. i asked her where she\\r\\nmet with this stuff; she answered, where there was more of it, under a\\r\\nthing like our bed, in a cloth like our sheet, which she cut open,\\r\\nand took it out of.--\"well,\" says i, \"and what will you do with\\r\\nthis?\"--\"why, i will make me a coat like yours,\" says she, \"for i don\\'t\\r\\nlike to look different from my dear husband and children.\"--\"no,\\r\\nyouwarkee,\" replied i, \"you must not do so; if you make such a jacket as\\r\\nmine, there will be no distinction between glumm and gawry;* the gowren\\r\\npraave,** in my country, would not on any account go dressed like a\\r\\nglumm; for they wear a fine flowing garment called a gown, that sits\\r\\ntight about the waist, and hangs down from thence in folds, like your\\r\\nbarras, *** almost to the ground, so that you can hardly discern their\\r\\nfeet, and no other part of their body but their hands and face, and\\r\\nabout as much of their neck and breasts as you see in your graundee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     * man and woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ** modest women.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ***the back flap of the graundee.\\r\\n\\r\\nyouwarkee seemed highly delighted with this new-fancied dress, and\\r\\nworked day and night at it against the cold weather. whilst she employed\\r\\nherself thus, i was busied in providing my winter stores, which i was\\r\\nforced to do alone now, herself and children taking up all my wife\\'s\\r\\ntime. about a fortnight after she had begun mantua-making, she presented\\r\\nherself to me one day, as i came from work, in her new gown; and, truly,\\r\\nconsidering the scanty description i had given her of such a garment,\\r\\nit appeared a good comely dress. though it had not one plait about the\\r\\nbody, it sat very tight thereto, and yet hung down full enough for a\\r\\ncountess; for she would have put it all in (all the stuff she had) had\\r\\nthere been as much more of it. i could see no opening before, so asked\\r\\nher how she got it on. she told me she laid along on the ground, and\\r\\ncrept through the plaits at the bottom, and sewed the body round her\\r\\nafter she had got her hands and arms through the sleeves. i wondered at\\r\\nher contrivance; and, smiling, showed her how she should put it on, and\\r\\nalso how to pin it before: and after she had done that, and i had turned\\r\\nup about half a yard of sleeve, which then hung down to her fingers\\'\\r\\nends, i kissed her, and called her my country-woman; of which, and her\\r\\nnew gown, she was very proud for a long time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xxi.\\r\\n\\r\\n     the author gets a breed of poultry, and by what means--\\r\\n     builds them a house--how he managed to keep them in winter\\r\\n\\r\\none day, as i was traversing the woods to view my bird-traps, looking\\r\\ninto the underwood among the great trees on my right hand, i saw a\\r\\nwood-hen (a bird i used to call so, from its resemblance in make to our\\r\\nenglish poultry) come out of a little thicket. i know not whether my\\r\\nrustling or what had disturbed it; but i let her pass, and she ran away\\r\\nbefore me. when she was fairly out of sight, i stepped up, and found\\r\\nshe had a nest and sixteen eggs there. i exactly marked the place, and\\r\\ntaking away one of the eggs, i broke it, at some distance from the nest,\\r\\nto see how forward they were; and i had no sooner broke the shell but\\r\\nout came a young chicken. i then looked into the nest again, and taking\\r\\nup more of the eggs, i found them all just splintered in the shell, and\\r\\nready for hatching. i had immediately a desire to save them, and bring\\r\\nthem up tame; but i was afraid if i took them away before they were\\r\\nhatched, and a little strengthened under the hen, they would all die; so\\r\\ni let them remain till next day. in the meanwhile i prepared some small\\r\\nnetting of such a proper size as i conceived would do, and with this\\r\\ni contrived, by fastening it to stakes which i fixed in the ground,\\r\\nto surround the nest, and me on the outside of it. all the while i was\\r\\ndoing this, the hen did not stir, so that i thought she had either been\\r\\nabsent when i came, or had hatched and gone off with the young ones. as\\r\\nto her being gone i was under no concern; for i had no design to\\r\\ncatch her, but only to confine the chickens within my net if they were\\r\\nhatched. but, however, i went nearer, and peeping in, found she sat\\r\\nstill, squeezing herself as flat to the ground as she could. i was in\\r\\ntwenty minds whether to take her first, and then catch the chickens, or\\r\\nto let her go off, and then clap upon them; but as i proposed to let her\\r\\ngo, i thought if she would sit still till i had got the chickens, that\\r\\nwould be the best way; so i softly kneeled down before her, and sliding\\r\\nmy hand under her, i gently drew out two, and put them in a bag i had in\\r\\nmy left hand. i then dipped again and again, taking two every turn; but\\r\\ngoing a fourth time, as i was bringing out my prize, the hen jumped up,\\r\\nflew out, and made such a noise that, though i the minute before saw six\\r\\nor seven more chicks in a lump where she had sat, and kept my eye upon\\r\\nthem, yet before i could put the last two i had got into my bag, these\\r\\nwere all gone, and in three hours\\' search i could not find one of them,\\r\\nthough i was sure they could not pass my net, and must be within the\\r\\ncompass of a small room, my toils enclosing no more. after tiring myself\\r\\nwith looking for them, i marched home with those eight i had got.\\r\\n\\r\\ni told youwarkee what i had done, and how i intended to manage the\\r\\nlittle brood, and, if i could, to bring them up tame. we kept them some\\r\\ndays very warm by the fire, and fed them often, as i had seen my mother\\r\\ndo with her early chickens; and in a fortnight\\'s time they were as stout\\r\\nand familiar as common poultry. we kept them a long while in the house;\\r\\nand when i fed them i always used them to a particular whistle, which\\r\\ni also taught my wife, that they might know both us and their\\r\\nfeeding-time; and in a very short while they would come running, upon\\r\\nthe usual sound, like barn-door fowls to the name of biddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nthere happened in this brood to be five hens and three cocks; and they\\r\\nwere now so tame that, having cut their wings, i let them out, when the\\r\\nweather favoured, at my door, where they would pick about in the wood,\\r\\nand get the best part of their subsistence; and having used them to\\r\\nroost in a corner of my ante-chamber, they all came in very regularly\\r\\nat night and took their places. my hens, at the usual season, laid me\\r\\nabundance of eggs, and hatched me a brood or two each of chickens; so\\r\\nthat now i was at a loss to know what to do with them, they were become\\r\\nso numerous. the ante-chamber was no longer a proper receptacle of such\\r\\na flock, and therefore i built a little house, at a small distance from\\r\\nmy own, on purpose for their reception and entertainment. i had by this\\r\\ntime cleared a spot of ground on one side of my grotto, by burning up\\r\\nthe timber and underwood which had covered it: this i enclosed, and\\r\\nwithin that enclosure i raised my aviary, and my poultry thrived very\\r\\nwell there, seemed to like their habitation, and grew very fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy wife and i took much delight in visiting and feeding them, and it was\\r\\na fine diversion also to my boys; but at the end of summer, when all\\r\\nthe other birds took their annual flight, away went every one of my\\r\\nnew-raised brood with them, and one of my old cocks, the rest of the old\\r\\nset remaining very quiet with me all the winter. the next summer, when\\r\\nmy chicks of that year grew up a little, i cut their wings, and by that\\r\\nmeans preserved all but one, which i suppose was either not cut so close\\r\\nas the rest, or his wings had grown again. from this time i found, by\\r\\nlong experience, that not two out of a hundred that had once wintered\\r\\nwith me would ever go away, though i did not cut their wings; but all of\\r\\nthe same season would certainly go off with the wild ones, if they could\\r\\nany ways make a shift to fly. i afterwards got a breed of blacknecks,\\r\\nwhich was a name i gave them from the peculiar blackness of their necks,\\r\\nlet the rest of their bodies be of what colour they would, as they\\r\\nare, indeed, of all colours. these birds were as big, or bigger, than a\\r\\nturkey, of a delicious flavour, and were bred from turkey eggs hatched\\r\\nunder my own wood-hens in great plenty. i was forced to clip these as\\r\\ni did the other young fowl, to keep them, and at length they grew very\\r\\ntame, and would return every night during the dark season. the greatest\\r\\ndifficulty now was to get meat for all these animals in the winter, when\\r\\nthey would sit on the roost two days together if i did not call and feed\\r\\nthem, which i was sometimes forced to do by lamp-light, or they would\\r\\nhave starved in cloudy weather. but i overcame that want of food by an\\r\\naccidental discovery; for i observed my blacknecks in the woods jump\\r\\nmany times together at a sort of little round heads, or pods, very dry,\\r\\nwhich hung plentifully upon a shrub that grew in great abundance there.\\r\\ni cut several of these heads, and carrying them home with me, broke\\r\\nthem, and took out a spoonful or more from each head of small yellow\\r\\nseeds, which giving to my poultry, and finding they greedily devoured\\r\\nthem, i soon laid in a stock for twice my number of mouths, so that they\\r\\nnever after wanted. i tried several times to raise a breed of water-fowl\\r\\nby hatching their eggs under my hens; but not one in ten of the sorts,\\r\\nwhen hatched, were fit to eat; and those that were would never live\\r\\nand thrive with me, but go away to the lake, i having no sort of water\\r\\nnearer me; so i dropped my design of water-fowl as impracticable. but by\\r\\nbreeding and feeding my land-fowl so constantly in my farmyard, i never\\r\\nwanted of that sort at my table, where we eat abundance of them; for my\\r\\nwhole side of the lake in a few years was like a farmyard, so full of\\r\\npoultry that i never knew my stock; and upon the usual whistle they\\r\\nwould flock round me from all quarters. i had everything now but cattle,\\r\\nnot only for the support, but convenience and pleasure of life; and so\\r\\nhappily should i have fared here, if i had had but a cow and bull, a ram\\r\\nand sheep, that i would not have changed my dominions for the crown of\\r\\nengland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xxii.\\r\\n\\r\\n     reflections on mankind--the author wants to be with his\\r\\n     ship--projects going, but perceives it impracticable--\\r\\n     youwarkee offers her service y and goes--an account of her\\r\\n     transactions on board-remarks on her sagacity--she\\r\\n     despatches several chests of goods through the gulf to the\\r\\n     lake--an account of a danger she escaped--the author has a\\r\\n     fit of sickness\\r\\n\\r\\nstrange is the temper of mankind, who, the more they enjoy, the\\r\\nmore they covet. before i received any return from my ship, i rested\\r\\ntolerably easy, and but seldom thought upon what i had left behind me\\r\\nin her, thinking myself happy in what i had, and completely so since\\r\\nmy union with my dear wife; but after i had got what i could never\\r\\nhave expected, i grew more and more perplexed for want of the rest, and\\r\\nthought i should never enjoy true happiness while even a plank of the\\r\\nship remained. my head, be i where i would, or at what i would, was ever\\r\\non board. i wished for her in the lake, and could i but have got her\\r\\nthither, i thought i should be an emperor; and though i wanted for\\r\\nnothing to maintain life, and had so good a wife and five children i was\\r\\nvery fond of, yet the one thing i had not, reduced the comfort of all\\r\\nthe rest to a scanty pattern, even so low as to destroy my whole peace.\\r\\ni was even mad enough to think of venturing up the cavern again, but was\\r\\nrestrained from the attempt by the certain impracticableness of it then\\r\\ni thought youwarkee should make another trip to the ship. but what can\\r\\nshe bring from it, says i to myself, in respect of what must be left\\r\\nbehind? her whole life will not suffice to clear it in, at the rate she\\r\\ncan fetch the loading hither in parcels. at last a project started, that\\r\\nas there were so many chests on board, youwarkee should fill some of\\r\\nthem and send them through the gulf to take their chance for the lake.\\r\\nthis, at first sight, seemed feasible; but then i considered how they\\r\\ncould be got from the ship to the gulf; and again, that they would never\\r\\nkeep out the water, and if they filled with a lading in them they would\\r\\nsink; or, if this did not happen, they might be dashed to pieces against\\r\\nthe crags in the cavern. these apprehensions stopped me again; till,\\r\\nunwilling to quit the thought, \"true,\" says i, \"this may happen to some;\\r\\nbut if i get but one in five, it is better than nothing.\" thus i turned\\r\\nand wound the affair in my mind; but objections still started too\\r\\nobstinate to be conquered.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the height of my soliloquy in comes youwarkee, and seeing my dejected\\r\\nlook, would needs know the meaning of it i told her plainly that i could\\r\\nget no rest from day to day ever since she first went to the ship, to\\r\\nthink such a number of good things lay there to be a prey to the sea, as\\r\\nthe ship wasted, when they might be of such infinite service here; and\\r\\nthat, since her last flight, i had suffered the more, when i thought how\\r\\nnear the gulf was to the ship; so that could i but get thither myself\\r\\nwith my boat, i would contrive to pack up the goods in the chests that\\r\\nwere on board, and carrying them in the boat, drop them near the draught\\r\\nof the water, which of itself would suck them under the rock down the\\r\\ngulf; and when they were passed through the cavern, i might take them\\r\\nup in the lake. \"well,\" says she, \"peter, and why cannot i do this for\\r\\nyou?\"--\"no,\" says i, \"even this has its objections.\" then i told her\\r\\nwhat i feared of their taking water, or dashing against the rock, and\\r\\ntwenty other ways of frustrating my views: \"but, above all,\" says i,\\r\\n\"how can you get such large and weighty things to the gulf without a\\r\\nboat? there is another impossibility! it won\\'t do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nyouwarkee eyed me attentively. \"pr\\'ythee, my dear peter,\" says she, \"set\\r\\nyour heart at rest about that. i can only try; if no good is to be\\r\\ndone, you shall soon know it, and must rest contented under the\\r\\ndisappointment.\"--i told her if i was there, i could take all the things\\r\\nout of the chests, and then melt some pitch and pour into every crack,\\r\\nto keep out the water when they were set afloat. \"pitch!\" says she,\\r\\n\"what\\'s that?\"--\"why,\" says i, \"that is a nasty, hard, black sticking\\r\\nthing that stands in tubs in the ship, and which being put over the fire\\r\\nin anything to melt will grow liquid, and when it is cold be hard again,\\r\\nand will resist the water and keep it out.\"--says she, \"how can i put\\r\\nthis pitch within-side of the chest-lid when i have tied it up?\"--\"it is\\r\\nto no manner of purpose,\" says i, \"to talk of it; so there\\'s an end of\\r\\nit.\"--\"but,\" says she, \"suppose yourself there, what things would you\\r\\nbring first?\"--i then entered into a long detail of particulars; saying\\r\\ni would have this and that, and so on, till i had scarce left out a\\r\\nthing i either knew of or could suppose to be in the ship; and for fear\\r\\ni had not mentioned all, says i at last, if i was there, i believe i\\r\\nshould leave but little portable behind me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"so, so, my dear,\" says youwarkee, \"you would roll in riches, i find;\\r\\nbut you have mentioned never a new gown for me.\"--\"why, aye!\" says i,\\r\\n\"i would have that too.\"--\"but how would you melt the pitch?\" says\\r\\nshe.--\"oh,\" says i, \"there is a tinder-box and matches in a room below,\\r\\nupon the side of the fire-hearth.\" and then i let her see one i had\\r\\nbrought with me, and showed her the use of the flint and steel.--\"well,\\r\\nmy dear,\" says she, \"will you once more trust me?\"--i told her, her\\r\\ngoing would be of little more use than to get a second gown or some such\\r\\nthing; but if she was desirous, i would let her make another flight, on\\r\\nher promise to be back as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nin the evening she set out, and stayed two days, and till the night\\r\\nof the third. i would here observe that though it was much lighter and\\r\\nbrighter on the outside of the rock where the ship lay than with us at\\r\\ngraundevolet, yet having always her spectacles with her, i heard no\\r\\nmore complaint of the glare of light she used to be so much afraid of:\\r\\nindeed, she always avoided the fire and lamp at home as much as she\\r\\ncould, because she generally took off her spectacles within doors; but\\r\\nwhen at any time she had them on, she could bear both well enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nupon her return again, she told me she had shipped some goods to sea for\\r\\nme, which she hoped would arrive safe (for by this time she had had my\\r\\nseafaring terms so often over, she could apply them very properly),\\r\\nand that they were in six chests, which she had pitched after my\\r\\ndirections.--\"aye!\" says i, \"you have pitched them into the sea perhaps;\\r\\nbut after my directions, i am satisfied was beyond your ability.\"--\"you\\r\\nglumms,\" says she, \"think us gawrys very ignorant; but i\\'ll satisfy you\\r\\nwe are not so dull of apprehension as you would make us. did you not\\r\\nshow me one day how your boat was tarred and caulked, as you call\\r\\nit?\"--\"i did,\" says i; \"what then?\"--\"i\\'ll tell you,\" says she. \"when\\r\\ni had emptied the first chest, and set it properly, i looked about for\\r\\nyour pitch, which at last i found by its sticking to my fingers; i then\\r\\nput a good piece into a sort of little kettle, with a long handle, that\\r\\nlay upon the pitch.\"--\"oh, the pitch-ladle!\" says i.--\"i know not what\\r\\nyou call it,\" says she; \"but then i made a fire, as you told me, and\\r\\nmelted that stuff; afterwards turning up the chest side-ways, and then\\r\\nend-ways, i poured it into it, and let it settle in the cracks, and with\\r\\nan old stocking, such as yours, dipped into the pitch, i rubbed every\\r\\nplace where the boards joined. i then set the chest on the side of the\\r\\nship, and when the pitch was cold and hardened in it, filled it top-full\\r\\nof things: but when i had done thus, and shut the lid, i found that\\r\\nwould not come so close but i could get the blade of a knife through\\r\\nanywhere between it and the chest; whereupon i cut some long slips of\\r\\nthe cloth i was packing up, and fitting them all round the edge of the\\r\\nchest, i dipped them into the pitch, and laid them on hot; and where one\\r\\nslip would not do, i put two; and shutting the lid down close upon them,\\r\\ni nailed it, as i had seen you do some things, quite round; then tying a\\r\\nrope to the handle, i tipped the chest into the sea, holding the rope.\\r\\ni watched it some time, and seeing it swim well, i took flight with the\\r\\nrope in my hand, and drew the chest after me to the gulf, when, letting\\r\\ngo the rope, away it went. i served five more in the same manner: and\\r\\nnow, my dearest, i am here to tell you i hope you will be able to see at\\r\\nleast some of them, one time or other, in the lake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\ni admired in all this at the sagacity of the gawrys. alas! thinks i,\\r\\nwhat narrow-hearted creatures are mankind! did i not heretofore look\\r\\nupon the poor blacks in africa as little better than beasts, till my\\r\\nfriend glanlepze convinced me, by disabling the crocodile, the passage\\r\\nof the river, and several other achievements, that my own excellences\\r\\nmight have perished in a desert without his genius; and now what\\r\\ncould i, or almost any of us masterpieces of the creation (as we think\\r\\nourselves) and heaven\\'s peculiar favourites, have done in this present\\r\\ncase, that has been omitted by this woman (for i may justly style her so\\r\\nin an eminent degree), and that in a way to which she was bred an utter\\r\\nstranger?\\r\\n\\r\\nafter what i had heard from youwarkee, i grew much more cheerful;\\r\\nwhich she, poor creature, was remarkably pleased with. she went with me\\r\\nconstantly once, and sometimes twice a day, for several days together,\\r\\nto see what success at the lake; till at length she grew very impatient,\\r\\nfor fear, as she afterwards told me, i should either think she had not\\r\\ndone what she said, or had done it in an ineffectual manner. but one\\r\\nday, walking by the lake, i thought i saw something floating in the\\r\\nwater at a very great distance. \"youwarkee,\" says i, \"i spy a sail!\"\\r\\nthen running to my boat* and taking her in, away we went, plying my oars\\r\\nwith all my might; for i longed to see what it was. at nearer view\\r\\ni perceived it to be one of my wife\\'s fleet. but what added to my\\r\\nsatisfaction was to see youwarkee so pleased, for she could scarcely\\r\\ncontain herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we came close to it, up she started: \"now, my dear peter,\" says\\r\\nshe, \"torment yourself no more about your goods on board; for if this\\r\\nwill do, all shall be your own.\"--she then lent me a hand to take it\\r\\nin; but we had both work enough to compass it, the wood had soaked in so\\r\\nmuch water. we then made the best of our way homewards to my wet-dock;\\r\\nwhen, just as we had landed our treasure, we saw two more boxes coming\\r\\ndown the stream both together, whereupon we launched again, and brought\\r\\nthem in one by one; for i did not care to trust them both on one bottom,\\r\\nmy boat being in years, and growing somewhat crazy.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had now made a good day\\'s work of it; so, mooring the boat, we went\\r\\nhome, intending to be out next morning early with the cart, to convey\\r\\nour imports to the grotto.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter supper, youwarkee looking very earnestly at me, with tears just\\r\\nglittering in her eyes, broke out in these words--\"what should you\\r\\nhave thought, peter, to have seen me come sailing, drowned, through the\\r\\ncavern, tied to one of your chests?\"--\"heaven forbid such a thought, my\\r\\ncharmer!\" says i. \"but as you know i must have been rendered the most\\r\\nmiserable of all living creatures by such a sight, or anything else that\\r\\nwould deprive me of you, pray tell me how you could possibly have such a\\r\\nthought in your head?\"--she saw she had raised my concern, and was very\\r\\nsorry for what she had said. \"nothing, nothing,\" says she, \"my dear!\\r\\nit was only a fancy just come into my head.\"--\"my dear youwee,\" says i,\\r\\n\"you must let me know what you mean: i am in great pain till you explain\\r\\nyourself; for i am sure there is something more in what you say\\r\\nthan fancy; therefore, pray, if you love me, keep me on the rack no\\r\\nlonger.\"--\"ah, peter!\" says she, \"there was but a span between me and\\r\\ndeath not many days ago; and when i saw the line of the last chest we\\r\\ntook up just now, it gave so much horror i could scarce keep upon my\\r\\nfeet.\"--\"my dear youwee, proceed,\" says i; \"for i cannot bear my torment\\r\\ntill i have heard the worst.\"--\"why, peter,\" says she, \"now the danger\\r\\nis over, i shall tell you my escape with as much pleasure as i guess\\r\\nyou will take in hearing of it. you must know, my life,\" says she, \"that\\r\\nhaving cast that chest into the sea, as i was tugging it along by\\r\\nthat very line, it being one of the heaviest, and moving but slowly, i\\r\\ntwisted the string several times round my hand, one fold upon another,\\r\\nthe easier to tow it; when, drawing it rather too quick into the eddy,\\r\\nit pulled so hard against me, towards the gulf, and so quick, that i\\r\\ncould in no way loosen or disengage the cord from my fingers, but\\r\\nwas dragged thereby to the very rock, against which the chest struck\\r\\nviolently. my last thought, as i supposed it, was of you, my dear\" (on\\r\\nwhich she clasped me round the neck, in sense of her past agony); \"when\\r\\ntaking myself for lost, i forbore further resistance; at which instant\\r\\nthe line, slackening by the rebound of the chest, fell from my hand of\\r\\nitself, and the chest returning to the rock, went down the current. i\\r\\ntook a turn or two round on my graundee to recollect my past danger, and\\r\\nwent back to the ship, fully resolved to avoid the like snare for the\\r\\nfuture. indeed i did not easily recover my spirits, and was so terrified\\r\\nwith the thought, that i had half a mind to have left the two remaining\\r\\nchests behind me; but as danger overcome gives fresh resolution, i again\\r\\nset to work, and discharged them also down the gulf, as i hope you will\\r\\nsee in good time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nmy heart bled within me all the while she spoke, and i even felt\\r\\nten times more than she could have suffered by the gulf. \"my dearest\\r\\nyouwee,\" says i, \"why did you not tell me this adventure sooner?\" \"it is\\r\\ntoo soon, i fear, now!\" says she; for she then saw the colour forsake\\r\\nmy lips, my eyes grow languid, and myself dropping into her arms. she\\r\\nscreamed out, and ran to the chest, where all was empty; but turning\\r\\nevery bottle up, and from the remaining drops in each collecting a small\\r\\nquantity of liquor, and putting it by little and little to my lips, and\\r\\nrubbing my wrists and temples, she brought me to myself again; but i\\r\\ncontinued so extremely sick for some days after, that it was above a\\r\\nweek before i could get down with my cart to fetch up my chests.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen i was able to go down, youwarkee would not venture me alone, but\\r\\nwent herself with me. we then found two more of the chests, which we\\r\\nlanded; and i had work sufficient for two or three days in getting them\\r\\nall up to the grotto, they were so heavy, and all the way through the\\r\\nwood being up hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe had five in hand, and watched several days for the sixth, when seeing\\r\\nnothing of it we gave it over for lost; but one day, as i was going for\\r\\nwater, youwarkee would go with me, and urged our carrying the net, that\\r\\nwe might drag for some fish. accordingly we did so; and now having taken\\r\\nwhat we wanted, we went to the rill, and pushing in the head of the boat\\r\\n(as i usually did, for by that means i could fill the vessel as i stood\\r\\non board), the first thing that appeared was my sixth chest. youwarkee\\r\\nspied it first, and cried, pointing thereto, \"o peter, what we have long\\r\\nwished for, and almost despaired of, is come at last! let us meet and\\r\\nwelcome it.\" i was pleased with the gaiety of her fancy. i did as she\\r\\ndesired; we got it into the boat, after merrily saluting it, and so\\r\\nreturned home. it took us up several days time in searching, sorting,\\r\\nand disposing our cargo, and drying the chests; for the goods themselves\\r\\nwere so far from being wetted or spoiled, that even those in the last\\r\\nchest, which had lain so long in the water, had not taken the least\\r\\nmoisture.\\r\\n\\r\\nyouwarkee was quite alert at the success of her packing, but left me\\r\\nto ring her praises, which i did not fail of doing more than once at\\r\\nunpacking each chest, and could see her eyes glow with delight to see\\r\\nshe had so pleased me.\\r\\n\\r\\nshe had been so curious as to examine almost everything in the ship; and\\r\\nas well of things i had described, and she did know, as of what she did\\r\\nnot, brought me something for a sample; but, above all, had not forgot\\r\\nthe blue stuff, for the moment she had seen that she destined it to the\\r\\nuse of herself and children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xxiii.\\r\\n\\r\\n     the religion of the author\\'s family.\\r\\n\\r\\nyouwarkee and i having fixed ourselves, by degrees, into a settled rota\\r\\nof action, began to live like christians, having so great a quantity of\\r\\nmost sorts of necessaries about us. but i say we lived like christians\\r\\non another account, for you must not think, after what i have said\\r\\nbefore, that i and my family lived like heathens; no, i will assure\\r\\nyou, they by degrees knew all i knew, and that, with a little artificial\\r\\nimprovement, and a well-regulated disposition, i hoped, and did not\\r\\ndoubt, would carry them all to heaven. i would many a time have given\\r\\nall my interest in the ship\\'s cargo for a bible; and a hundred times\\r\\ngrieved that i was not master of a pocket one, which i might have\\r\\ncarried everywhere about me. i never imagined there was one aboard, and\\r\\nif there were, and you-warkee should find it, i supposed it would be in\\r\\nportuguese, which i knew little of, so it would be of small service to\\r\\nme if i had it.\\r\\n\\r\\nsince i am on the topic of religion, it may not be amiss, once for all,\\r\\nto give you a small sketch of my religious proceedings after coming into\\r\\nmy new dominions. i have already told you that from my first stop at the\\r\\nrock i had prayed constantly morning and evening, but i cannot say i did\\r\\nit always with the same efficacy. however, my imperfect devotions were\\r\\nnot without good effect; and i am confident, wherever this course is\\r\\npursued with a right view, sooner or later the issue will prove the\\r\\nsame to others as i found it to myself; i mean, that mercies will be\\r\\nremembered with more gratitude, and evils be more disregarded, and\\r\\nbecome less burdensome; and surely the person whose case this is, must\\r\\nnecessarily enjoy the truest relish of life. as daily prayer was my\\r\\npractice, in answer to it i obtained the greatest blessing and comfort\\r\\nmy solitude was capable of receiving; i mean my wife, whose character i\\r\\nneed not farther attempt to blazon in any faint colours of my own after\\r\\nwhat has been already said, her acts having spoken her virtues beyond\\r\\nall verbal description.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter we were married, as i call it--that is, after we had agreed to\\r\\nbecome man and wife--i frequently prayed before her, and with her (for\\r\\nby this time she understood a good deal of my language); at which,\\r\\nthough contrary to my expectation, she did not seem surprised, but\\r\\nreadily kneeled by and joined with me. this i liked very well; and upon\\r\\nmy asking her one day after prayer if she understood what i had been\\r\\ndoing (for i had a notion she did not)--\"yes, verily,\" says she, \"you\\r\\nhave been making petitions to the image of the great collwar.\"*--\"pray,\"\\r\\nsays i (willing gently to lead her into a just sense of a supreme\\r\\nbeing), \"who is this collwar? and where does he dwell?\"--\"he it is,\"\\r\\nsays she, \"that does all good and evil to us.\"--\"right,\" says i, \"it\\r\\nis in some measure so; but he cannot of himself do evil, absolutely and\\r\\nproperly, as his own act\"--\"yes,\" says she, \"he can; for he can do all\\r\\nthat can be done; and as evil can be done, he can do it.\"--so quick a\\r\\nreply startled me. thinks i, she will run me aground presently; and from\\r\\nbeing a doctor, as i fancied myself, i shall become but a pupil to my\\r\\nown scholar. i then asked her where the great collwar dwelt? she told\\r\\nme in heaven, in a charming place.--\"and can he know what we do?\" says\\r\\ni.--\"yes,\" replied she, \"his image tells him everything; and i have\\r\\nprayed to his image, which i have often seen, and it is filled with so\\r\\nmuch virtue that it is his second self; for there is only one of them\\r\\nin the world who is so good: he gives several virtues to other images\\r\\nof himself, which are brought to him, and put into his arms to breathe\\r\\nupon; and the only thing i have ever regretted since i knew you is, that\\r\\ni have not one of them here to comfort and bless us and our children.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     * god.\\r\\n\\r\\nthough i was sorry for the oddity of her conceptions, i was almost glad\\r\\nto find her so ignorant, and pleased myself with thinking that as she\\r\\nhad already a confused notion of a supreme power, i should soon have the\\r\\nsatisfaction of bringing her to a more rational knowledge of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"pray, youwee,\" says i, \"what is your god made of?\"--\"why of clay,\" says\\r\\nshe, \"finely painted, and looks so terrible he would make you tremble to\\r\\nbehold him.\"--\"do you think,\" says i, \"that is the true collwar\\'s real\\r\\nshape, if you could see himself?\" she told me yes, for that some of his\\r\\nbest servants had seen him, and took the representation from himself.\\r\\n\"and pray, do you think he loves his best servants, as you call them,\\r\\nand is kind to them?\"--\"you need not doubt it,\" says she.--\"why, then,\"\\r\\nreplied i, \"how came he to look so terrible upon them when they saw him,\\r\\nas you say they did? for i can see no reason, how terrible soever he\\r\\nlooks to others, why he should show himself so to those he loves. i\\r\\nshould rather think, as you say he is kind to them, that he should have\\r\\ntwo images, a placid one for his good, and a terrible one for his bad\\r\\nservants; or else, who by seeing him can tell whether he is pleased or\\r\\nangry? for even you yourself, youwee, when anything pleases you, have a\\r\\ndifferent look from that you have when you are angry, and little pedro\\r\\ncan tell whether he does well or ill by your countenance; whereas,\\r\\nif you made no distinction, but looked with the same face on all his\\r\\nactions, he would as readily think he did well as ill in committing\\r\\na bad action.\" youwarkee could not tell what to say to this, the fact\\r\\nseeming against her.\\r\\n\\r\\ni then asked her if she thought the image itself could hear her\\r\\npetitions. she replied, \"yes.\"--\"and can he,\" says i, \"return you an\\r\\nanswer?\"--she told me he only did that to his best servants.--\"did you\\r\\never hear him do it?\" says i. \"for unless he can speak too, i should\\r\\nmuch suspect his hearing; and you being one of his best servants, seeing\\r\\nyou love him, and pray heartily to him, why should you not hear him as\\r\\nsoon as others?\"--\"no,\" says she, \"there are a great number of glumms\\r\\non purpose to serve him, pray for us to him, and receive his\\r\\nanswers.\"--\"but to what purpose then,\" says i, \"is your praying to him,\\r\\nif their prayers will serve your turn?\"--\"oh,\" says she, \"the image\\r\\nhears them sooner than us, and sends the petitions up to the great\\r\\ncollwar, and lets him know who makes them, and desires him to let them\\r\\nhave what they want.\"--\"but suppose,\" says i, for argument sake, \"that\\r\\nyou could see the great collwar, or know where he was, and should pray\\r\\nto himself, without going about to his image first, do you think he\\r\\ncould not hear you?\"--\"i cannot tell that,\" says she.--\"but how then,\"\\r\\nsays i, \"can he tell what (if it could speak) his image says, which is\\r\\nas far from him and then her own zealous application, with god\\'s grace,\\r\\nsoon brought her to a firm belief in it, and a suitable temper and\\r\\nconduct with respect to god and man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nafter i had begun with my children, i frequently referred their further\\r\\ninstruction to their mother; for i have always experienced that a\\r\\nsuperficial knowledge, with a desire of becoming a teacher, is in some\\r\\nmeasure equivalent to better knowledge; for it not only excites every\\r\\nprinciple one has to the utmost, but makes matters more clear and\\r\\nconspicuous even to one\\'s self.\\r\\n\\r\\nby these means, and the divine blessing thereon, in a few years, i may\\r\\nfairly say, i had a little christian church in my own house, and in a\\r\\nflourishing way too, without a schismatic or heretic amongst us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xxiv.\\r\\n\\r\\n     the author\\'s account of his children--their names--they are\\r\\n     exercised in flying--his boat crazy--youwarkee intends a\\r\\n     visit to her father\\', but first takes another flight to the\\r\\n     ship--sends a boat and chests through the gulf--clothes her\\r\\n     children--is with child again, so her visit is put off--an\\r\\n     inventory of the last freight of goods--the author\\'s method\\r\\n     of treating his children--youwarkee, her son tommy, with her\\r\\n     daughters patty and hally-carnie, set out to her father\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had now lived here almost fourteen years, and besides the three sons\\r\\nbefore mentioned, had three girls and one boy. pedro, my eldest, had\\r\\nthe graundee, but too small to be useful; my second son tommy had it\\r\\ncomplete, so had my three daughters, but jemmy and david, the youngest\\r\\nsons, none at all. my eldest daughter i named patty, because i always\\r\\ncalled my first wife so. i say my first wife, though i had no other\\r\\nknowledge of her death than my dream; but am from that as verily\\r\\npersuaded, if ever i reach england, i shall find it so, as if i had\\r\\nheard it from her aunt\\'s own mouth. my second daughter my wife desired\\r\\nmight be called by her sister\\'s name hallycarnie, and my youngest i\\r\\nnamed sarah, after my mother. i put you to the trouble of writing down\\r\\nthe names, for as i shall hereafter have frequent occasion to mention\\r\\nthe children severally, it will be pleasanter for myself and you to call\\r\\nthem by their several names of distinction, than to call them my second\\r\\nson, or my eldest daughter, and so forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy wife now took great delight in exercising tommy and patty (who were\\r\\nbig enough to be trusted) in flighty and would often skim round the\\r\\nwhole island with them before i could walk half through the wood. and\\r\\nshe would teach them also to swim or sail, i know not which to call it,\\r\\nfor sometimes you should see them dart out of the air as if they would\\r\\nfall on their faces into the lake, when coming near the surface they\\r\\nwould stretch their legs in a horizontal posture, and in an instant turn\\r\\non their backs, and then you could see nothing from the bank, to all\\r\\nappearance, but a boat sailing along, the graundee rising at their head,\\r\\nfeet, and sides, so like the sides and ends of a boat that you could not\\r\\ndiscern the face or any part of the body. i own i often envied them this\\r\\nexercise, which they seemed to perform with more ease than i could only\\r\\nshake my leg or stir an arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nthough we had perpetually swangeans about us, and the voices, as i used\\r\\nto call them, i could never once prevail on my wife to show herself,\\r\\nor to claim any acquaintance with her country folks. and what is very\\r\\nremarkable in my children is, that my three daughters and tommy, who had\\r\\nthe full graundee, had exactly their mother\\'s sight, jemmy and david had\\r\\njust my sight, and pedro\\'s sight was between both, though he was never\\r\\nmuch affected with any light; but i was obliged to make spectacles for\\r\\ntommy and all my daughters when they came to go abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\ni had in this time twice enlarged my dwelling, which the increase of my\\r\\nfamily had rendered necessary. the last alteration i was enabled to do\\r\\nin a much better manner, and with more ease, than the first, for by\\r\\nthe return of my flota i had gotten a large collection of useful tools,\\r\\nseveral of iron, where the handles or wood-work preponderated the iron;\\r\\nbut such as was all, or greatest part of that metal, had got either to\\r\\nthe rock, or were so fast fixed to the head of the ship, that it was\\r\\ndifficult to remove them, so that my wife could get comparatively few of\\r\\nthis latter sort, though some she did. it was well, truly, i had these\\r\\ninstruments, which greatly facilitated my labours, for i was forced to\\r\\nwork harder now than ever in making provision for us all; and my sons\\r\\npedro and tommy commonly assisted. i had also had another importation of\\r\\ngoods through the gulf, which still added to my convenience. but my boat\\r\\nmade me shudder every time i went into her; she had leaked again and\\r\\nagain, and i had patched her till i could scarce see a bit of the old\\r\\nwood. she was of unspeakable use to me, and yet i could not venture\\r\\nmyself in her, but with the utmost apprehension and trembling. i had\\r\\nbeen intending a good while, now i had such helps, to build a new one,\\r\\nbut had been diverted by one avocation or other.\\r\\n\\r\\nabout this time youwarkee, who was now upwards of thirty-two years of\\r\\nage, the fondest mother living, and very proud of her children, had\\r\\nformed a project of taking a flight to arndrumnstake, a town in the\\r\\nkingdom of doorpt swangeanti, as i called it, where her father, if\\r\\nliving, was a colamb * under georigetti, the prince of that country.\\r\\nshe imparted her desire to me, asking my leave; and she told me, if i\\r\\npleased, she would take patty and tommy along with her. i did not much\\r\\ndislike the proposal, because of the great inclination i had for a\\r\\nlong time to a knowledge of, and familiarity with, her countrymen and\\r\\nrelations; and now i had so many of her children with me, i could not\\r\\nthink she would ever be prevailed on, but by force, to quit me and her\\r\\noffspring, and be contented to lose six for the sake of having two with\\r\\nher, especially as she had showed no more love for them than the rest,\\r\\nso i made no hesitation, but told her she should go.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * governor.\\r\\n\\r\\ni expected continually i should hear of her departure, but she saying no\\r\\nmore of it, i thought she had dropped her design, and i did not choose\\r\\nto mention it. but one day, as we were at dinner, looking mighty\\r\\nseriously, she said, \"my dear, i have considered of the journey you have\\r\\nconsented i should take, but in order thereto it is necessary that i\\r\\nprepare several things for the children, especially those who have no\\r\\ngraundee, and i am resolved to finish them before i go, that we may\\r\\nappear with decency, both here and at arndrumn-stake; for i am sure my\\r\\nfather, whose temper i am perfectly acquainted with, will, upon sight of\\r\\nme and my little ones, be so overjoyed, that he will forgive my absence\\r\\nand marriage, provided he sees reason to believe i have not matched\\r\\nunworthily, unbecoming my birth; and after keeping me and the children\\r\\nwith him, it may be two or three months, will accompany me home again\\r\\nhimself with a great retinue of servants and relations; or, at least, if\\r\\nhe is either dead or unable for flight, my other relations will come or\\r\\nsend a convoy to take care of me and the children; and, my dear, as i\\r\\nshall give them all the encomiums i can of you, and of my situation with\\r\\nyou, while i am among them, i would have them a little taken with the\\r\\nelegance of our domestic condition when they come hither, that they\\r\\nmay think me happy in you and my children; for i would not only put my\\r\\nfamily into a condition to appear before them, but to surprise the old\\r\\ngentleman and his company, who never in their lives saw any part of\\r\\nmankind with another covering than the graundee.\" when she had done, i\\r\\nexpressed my approbation of her whole system, as altogether prudent,\\r\\nand she proceeded immediately to put it in execution. to work she went,\\r\\nopened every chest, and examined their contents. but while she was upon\\r\\nthe hunt, and selecting such things as she thought fit for her purpose,\\r\\nshe recollected several articles she had observed in the ship, which\\r\\nshe judged far more for her turn than any she had at home. hereupon she\\r\\nprayed me to let her take another trip to the vessel, and to carry tommy\\r\\nwith her.\\r\\n\\r\\nafter so many trials, and such happy experience of her wise and\\r\\nfortunate conduct, i consented to her flight, and away went she and her\\r\\nson. upon their return, which was in a few days, she told me what they\\r\\nhad been doing, and said, as she so often heard me complain of the age\\r\\nof my boat, and fear to sail in her, she had fitted me out a little\\r\\nship, and hoped it would in due time arrive safely. as she passed\\r\\nquickly on to other things, i never once thought of asking her what\\r\\nshe meant by the little ship she spoke of; but must own that, like a\\r\\nfoolishly fond parent, i was more intent on her telling me how tommy had\\r\\nfound a hoard of playthings, which he had packed up for his own use.\\r\\n\\r\\nas to this last particular, i learned by the sequel of the story,\\r\\nwhen the spark, proud of his acquisition, came to me, that he had been\\r\\npeeping about in the cabin whilst his mother was packing the chests, and\\r\\nseeing a small brass knob in the wainscot, took it for a plaything, and\\r\\npulling to get it out, opened a little door of a cupboard, where he\\r\\nhad found some very pretty toys that he positively claimed for himself,\\r\\namong which were a small plain gold ring, and a very fine one set with\\r\\ndiamonds, which he showed me upon two of his fingers. i wondered how the\\r\\nchild, who had never before seen such things, or the use of them, should\\r\\nhappen to apply these so properly; but he told me in playing with\\r\\nthis, meaning the diamond ring, about his fingers, it slipped over his\\r\\nmiddle-finger joint, and he could not get it off again, so he put the\\r\\nother upon another finger to keep it company.\\r\\n\\r\\nwe watched daily, as usual on such occasions, for the arrival of our\\r\\nfleet. it was surprising that none of the chests which youwarkee shot\\r\\ndown the gulf were ever half so long in their passage as i was myself,\\r\\nbut some came in a week, some in a few days more, and even some in less,\\r\\nwhich i attributed to their following directly the course of the water,\\r\\nshooting from shelf to shelf as the tide sat; and i believe my keeping\\r\\nthe boat i sailed in so strictly and constantly in the middle of the\\r\\nstream, was the reason of my being detained there so long. in less than\\r\\na fortnight everything came safe but one chest, which, as we never heard\\r\\nof it, i suppose was either sunk or bulged.\\r\\n\\r\\nbeing one day upon shore, watching to see if anything more was come\\r\\nthrough the cavern, i spied at a distance somewhat looking very black\\r\\nand very long, and by the colour and shape thereof i took it for a young\\r\\nwhale. having observed it some time making very little way, i took my\\r\\nold boat and followed it, but was afraid to go near it, lest a stroke\\r\\nwith its tail--which i then fancied i saw move--might endanger my boat\\r\\nand myself too; but creeping nearer and nearer, and seeing it did not\\r\\nstir, i believed it to be dead; whereupon, taking courage, i drew so\\r\\nclose that at length i plainly perceived it was the ship\\'s second boat\\r\\nturned upside down. it is not easy to express the joy i felt on this\\r\\ndiscovery. it was the very thing i was now, as i have said, in the\\r\\ngreatest want of. i presently laid hold of it and brought it ashore; and\\r\\nit was no small pleasure to find, on examining, that though it had lain\\r\\nso long dry, it was yet quite sound, and all its chinks filled up in\\r\\nits passage; and it proved to me afterwards the most beneficial thing i\\r\\ncould have had from the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\ni got all my goods home from the lake to my grotto, by means of the\\r\\ncart, as usual. my wife and daughters waited with impatience for me\\r\\nto unpack, that they might take possession of such things as would be\\r\\nneedful for rigging out the family against the supposed reception of\\r\\nthe old glumm, and had set all the chests in the order they desired they\\r\\nmight be opened in. but tommy running to me, with a \"pray, daddy, open\\r\\nmy chest first! pray, give me my playthings first!\" it was, to satisfy\\r\\nhim, concluded in favour of his demand. so, he pointing to the chest\\r\\nwhich he regarded as his property, i opened it, whilst his eyes were\\r\\nready to pierce through it, till i came to his treasure. \"there, there\\r\\nthey are, daddy!\" says he, as soon as i had uncovered them. and indeed,\\r\\nwhen i saw them, i could not but much commend the child for his fancy;\\r\\nfor the first things that appeared were a silver punch or wine can and\\r\\na ladle, then a gold watch, a pair of scissors, a small silver\\r\\nchafing-dish and lamp, a large case of mathematical instruments, a\\r\\nflageolet, a terrella or globular loadstone, a small globe, a dozen of\\r\\nlarge silver spoons, and a small case of knives and forks and spoons;\\r\\nin short, there was, i believe, the greatest part of the portuguese\\r\\ncaptain\\'s valuable effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nthese tommy claiming as his own proper chattels, i could not help\\r\\ninterposing somewhat of my authority in the affair. \"hold, hold, son!\"\\r\\nsays i, \"these things are all mine; but as i have several of you who\\r\\nwill all be equally pleased with them, though, as the first finder, you\\r\\nmay be entitled to the best share, you are not to grasp the whole, you\\r\\nmust all have something like an equality; and as to some things which\\r\\nmay be equally useful to us all, they must be set up to be used upon\\r\\noccasion, and are to be considered as mine and your mother\\'s property.\"\\r\\ni thereupon gave each of them a large silver spoon, and with a fork i\\r\\nscratched the initials of their names respectively on them, and divided\\r\\nseveral of the trifles amongst them equally. \"and now, tommy,\" says i,\\r\\n\"you for your pains shall have this more than the rest,\" offering him\\r\\nthe flageolet. tommy looked very gloomy, and though he durst not find\\r\\nfault, his dissatisfaction was very visible by coolly taking it, tossing\\r\\nit down, and walking gravely off. \"i thought,\" says i, \"tommy, i had\\r\\nmade a good choice for you; but, as i find you despise it, here, pedro,\\r\\ndo you take that pretty thing, since your brother slights it\" tommy\\r\\nreplied, speaking but half out, and a little surly, more than i ever\\r\\nobserved before, \"let him take it if he will, i can get bits of sticks\\r\\nenough in the wood.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nmy method had always been to avoid either beating or scolding at my\\r\\nchildren, for preferring their own opinion to mine; but i ever let\\r\\nthings turn about so, that from their own reason they should perceive\\r\\nthey had erred in opposing my sentiments, by which means they grew so\\r\\nhabituated to submit to my advice and direction, that for the most part\\r\\nmy will was no sooner known to them than it became their own choice; but\\r\\nthen i never willed according to fancy only, but with judgment, to the\\r\\nbest of my skill.\\r\\n\\r\\ntommy, therefore, as i said before, having shown a disapprobation of my\\r\\ndoings; to convince him of his mistake, i took the flageolet from pedro.\\r\\n\"and now, pedro,\" says i, \"let me teach you how to manage this piece of\\r\\nwood, as tommy calls it, and then let me see if in all the grove he can\\r\\ncut such another.\" on this i clapped it to my mouth, and immediately\\r\\nplayed several country-dances and hornpipes on it; for though my mother\\r\\nhad scarce taught me to read, i had learnt music and dancing, being, as\\r\\nshe called them, gentlemanlike accomplishments. my wife and children,\\r\\nespecially tommy, all stared as if they were wild, first on me, then on\\r\\none another, whilst i played a country-dance; but i had no sooner struck\\r\\nup an hornpipe, than their feet, arms, and heads had so many twitching\\r\\nand convulsive motions, that not one quiet limb was to be seen amongst\\r\\nthem; till having exercised their members as long as i saw fit, i almost\\r\\nlaid them all to sleep with chevy chase, and so gave over.\\r\\n\\r\\nthey no sooner found themselves free from this enchantment, than the\\r\\nchildren all hustled round me in a cluster, all speaking together,\\r\\nand reaching out their little hands to the instrument i gave it\\r\\npedro. \"there,\" says i to him, \"take this slighted favour as no such\\r\\ncontemptible present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\npoor tommy, who had all this while looked very simple, burst into a\\r\\nflood of tears at my last words, as if his heart would have broke; and\\r\\nrunning to me, fell on his knees, and begged my pardon, hoping i would\\r\\nforgive him. i took him up, and kissing him, told him he had very little\\r\\noffended me; for, as he knew, i had more children to give anything to\\r\\nwhich either of the rest despised; it was equal to me who had it, so it\\r\\nwas thankfully received. i found that did not satisfy; still in tears,\\r\\nhe said, \"might he not have the stick again, as i gave it to him first?\"\\r\\n\"tommy,\" says i, \"you know i gave it to you first; but you disapproving\\r\\nmy kindness, i have now given it pedro, who, should i against his will\\r\\ntake it from him, would have that reason to complain which you have not,\\r\\nwho parted with it by your own consent; and therefore, tommy, as i am\\r\\ndetermined to acquaint you as near as i can with the strict rules of\\r\\njustice, there must no more be said to me of this matter.\" such as this\\r\\nwas my constant practice amongst them; and they having always found me\\r\\ninflexible from this rule, we seldom had any long debates.\\r\\n\\r\\nthough i say the affair ended so with regard to what i had to do in it,\\r\\nyet it ended not so with tommy; for though he knew he had no hopes of\\r\\nmoving me, he set all his engines at work to recover his stick, as he\\r\\ncalled it, by his mother\\'s and sisters\\' interest. these solicited pedro\\r\\nvery strongly to gratify him. at length pedro--he being a boy of a most\\r\\nhumane disposition--granted their desire, if i would give leave; and i\\r\\nhaving signified, that the cause being now out of my hands, he might do\\r\\nas he pleased, he generously yielded it. and indeed he could not have\\r\\nbestowed it more properly; for tommy had the best ear for music i ever\\r\\nknew; and in less than a twelvemonth could far outdo me, his instructor,\\r\\nin softness and easiness of finger; and was also master of every tune\\r\\ni knew, which were neither inconsiderable in number, nor of the lowest\\r\\nrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nyouwarkee, with her daughters, sat close to work, and had but just\\r\\ncompleted her whole design for the family clothing, when she told me\\r\\nshe found herself with child again. as that circumstance ill suited a\\r\\njourney, she deferred her flight for about fifteen months; in which time\\r\\nshe was brought to bed, and weaned the infant, which was a boy, whom\\r\\ni named richard, after my good master at the academy. the little knave\\r\\nthrived amain, and was left to my farther nursing during its mammy\\'s\\r\\nabsence; who, still firm to her resolution, after she had equipped\\r\\nherself and companions with whatever was necessary to their travelling,\\r\\nand locked up all the apparel she had made till her return, because\\r\\nshe would have it appear new when her father came, set out with her son\\r\\ntommy and my two daughters patty and hallycarnie, the last of which by\\r\\nthis time being big enough also to be trusted with her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xxv.\\r\\n\\r\\n     youwarkee\\'s account of the stages to arndrumstake--the\\r\\n     author uneasy at her flight--his employment in her absence;\\r\\n     and preparations for receiving her father--how he spent the\\r\\n     evenings with the children.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy wife was now upon her journey to her father\\'s; but where that was, or\\r\\nhow far off, it was impossible for me to conceive by her description\\r\\nof the way; for she distinguished it not by miles or leagues, but by\\r\\nswan-geans, and names of rocks, seas, and mountains, which i\\r\\ncould neither comprehend the distance of from each other, nor from\\r\\ngraundevolet, where i was. i understood by her, indeed, there was a\\r\\ngreat sea to be passed, which would take her up almost a day and night,\\r\\nhaving the children with her, before she reached the next arkoe, though\\r\\nshe could do it herself she said, and strain hard, in a summer\\'s\\r\\nnight; but if the children should flag by the way, as there was no\\r\\nresting-place between us and battringdrigg, the next arkoe, it might\\r\\nbe dangerous to them, so she would take the above time for their sakes.\\r\\nafter this, i found by what she said there was a narrow sea to pass, and\\r\\na prodigious mountain, before she reached her own country; and that her\\r\\nfather\\'s was but a little beyond that mountain. this was all i could\\r\\nknow in general about it. at their departure she and the children had\\r\\ntaken each a small provision for their flight, which hung about their\\r\\nnecks in a sort of purse.\\r\\n\\r\\ni cannot say, notwithstanding this journey was taken with my concurrence\\r\\nand consent, that i was perfectly easy when they were gone, for my\\r\\naffection for them all would work up imaginary fears too potent for my\\r\\nreason to dispel, and which at first sat with no easy pressure upon\\r\\nmy mind. this my pretty babies at home perceiving, used all the little\\r\\nwinning arts they could to divert and keep up my spirits; and from day\\r\\nto day, by taking them abroad with me, and playing with and amusing them\\r\\nat home, i grew more and more persuaded that all would go right with the\\r\\nabsent, and that in due time i should see them return again.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut as the winter set in, i went little abroad, and then we employed\\r\\nourselves within doors in preparing several things which might not only\\r\\nbe useful and ornamental, if the old glumm should come to see us, but\\r\\nmight also divert us, and make the time pass less tediously. the first\\r\\nthing i went upon was a table, which, as my family consisted of so many,\\r\\ni intended to make big enough for us all. with that view i broke up a\\r\\ncouple of chests, and, taking the two sides of one of them, i nailed\\r\\nthem edge to edge by strong thick pieces underneath at each end and in\\r\\nthe middle; then i took two chest-lids with their hinges, nailing one\\r\\nto each side of my middle piece, which made two good flaps; after this,\\r\\nwith my tools, of which i had now a chest-full, i chopped out of new\\r\\nstuff and planed four strong legs quite square, and nailed them strongly\\r\\nto each corner of my middle board; i then nailed pieces from one leg to\\r\\nthe other, and nailed the bed likewise to them; then i fastened a border\\r\\nquite round within six inches from the bottom, from foot to foot, which\\r\\nheld all fast together. when all this was done, still my table was\\r\\nimperfect; i could not put up the flaps, having no proper support. to\\r\\nremedy this i sawed out a broad slip from a chest-side, and boring a\\r\\nlarge hole through the centre, i spiked it up to the under-side of the\\r\\ntable\\'s bed, with a spindle i contrived just loose enough to play round\\r\\nthe head of the spike, filing down that part of the spindle which passed\\r\\nthrough the bed of the table, and riveting it close; so that when my\\r\\nflaps were set up i pulled the slip crosswise of the table, and when the\\r\\nflaps were down, the slip turned under the top of the table lengthwise:\\r\\nnext, under each flap, i nailed a small slip lengthwise of the flaps,\\r\\nto raise them on a level, when up, with the top of the table. when i had\\r\\nthus completed the several parts of this needful utensil, i spent some\\r\\ntime and pains by scraping and rubbing, to render it all as elegant as\\r\\ncould be, and the success so well answered my wish, that i was not a\\r\\nlittle proud of the performance; and what rendered my work thereon a\\r\\nstill more agreeable task, was my pretty infants\\' company, who stood by,\\r\\nexpressing their wonder and approbation at every stroke.\\r\\n\\r\\nnow i had gotten a table, i wanted chairs to it; for as yet we had\\r\\nonly sat round the room upon chests, which formed a bench of the whole\\r\\ncircumference, they stood so thick. there was no moving of them without\\r\\na monstrous trouble every time i might have occasion to set out my\\r\\ntable: besides, if i could have dragged them backwards and forwards,\\r\\nthey were too low to be commodious for seats; so i resolved to make some\\r\\nchairs and stools also, that might be manageable. i will not trouble you\\r\\nwith the steps i took in the formation of these; only, in general, you\\r\\nmust know, that some more chests i broke up to that purpose served me\\r\\nfor timber, out of which i framed six sizeable handsome chairs, and a\\r\\ncompetent number of stools.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut now that i was turned joiner, i had another convenience to provide\\r\\nfor. i had nothing wherein to enclose things, and preserve them from\\r\\ndust, except the chests, and they were quite unfit for holding liquors,\\r\\nvictuals, and such like matters, but open shells, as most of my vessels\\r\\nwere. wherefore, having several boards now remaining of the boxes i had\\r\\nbroken up for chairs and stools, i bethought me of supplying this great\\r\\ndeficiency; so of these spare boards, in a workmanlike way (for by this\\r\\ntime i was become a tolerable mechanic), i composed a very tight closet,\\r\\nholding half-a-dozen broad shelves, shut up by a good pair of doors,\\r\\nwith a lock and key to fasten them. these jobs took me up almost three\\r\\nmonths, and i thought i had not employed them idly, but for the credit\\r\\nand service of my family. i was now again at leisure for farther\\r\\nprojects. i was uncertain as to my wife\\'s return, how soon she might be\\r\\nwith me, or how much longer she might stay; but i was sure i could do\\r\\nnothing in the meanwhile more grateful than increasing, by all means in\\r\\nmy power, the accommodations of my house, for the more polite as well as\\r\\nconvenient reception of her father, or any else who might accompany her\\r\\nhome in the way of a retinue, as she talked of. i saw plainly i had not\\r\\nroom for lodging them, and that was a circumstance of main importance to\\r\\nbe provided for. hereupon i thought of adding a long apartment to one\\r\\nof my outer-rooms, to range against the side of the rock; but reflecting\\r\\nthat such a thing would be quite useless, unless i could finish it in\\r\\ntime, so as to be complete when my guests came, and not knowing how soon\\r\\nthat might be, i resolved to quit this design; and i fell upon another\\r\\nwhich might do as well, and required much less labour and fewer days to\\r\\nperfect.\\r\\n\\r\\ni remembered that amongst those things my wife had packed up on board\\r\\nthe ship, and which came home through the gulf, there were two of the\\r\\nlargest sails, and a couple of a smaller size. these i carried to\\r\\nthe wood, and tried them in several places to see where they might be\\r\\ndisposed to most advantage in the nature of a tent, and having found a\\r\\nconvenient spot to my purpose, i cut divers poles for supporters, and\\r\\nmaking straining lines of my matweed, i pitched a noble one, sufficient\\r\\nto cover or entertain a numerous company, and so tight everywhere as to\\r\\nkeep out the weather. the front of this new apartment i hung with blue\\r\\ncloth, which had a very genteel effect. i had almost forgotten to tell\\r\\nyou that i contrived (by hanging one of the smaller sails across, just\\r\\nin the middle, which i could let down or raise up at pleasure) to divide\\r\\nthe tent occasionally into two distinct rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen i had proceeded thus far, there were still wanting seats for this\\r\\nadditional building, as i may call it, and though i could spare some\\r\\nchests to sit on, i found they would not half do. for a supplement,\\r\\nthen, i took my axe and felled a couple of great trees, one from each\\r\\nside of the tent, sawed off the tops, and cut each of the trunks in two\\r\\nabout the middle: these huge cylinders i rolled into the tent with a\\r\\ngood deal of toil and difficulty; two of them i thrust into the inner\\r\\ndivision, and left two in the outer. i placed them as benches on both\\r\\nsides, then, with infinite pains, i shaved the upper face of each smooth\\r\\nand flat, and pared off all the little knots and roughnesses of the\\r\\nfront, so that they were fitted to sit on, and their own weight fixed\\r\\nthem in the place where i intended them to be. at the upper end of the\\r\\nfarther chamber i set three chests lengthwise for seats, or any other\\r\\nuse i might see fit to put them to.\\r\\n\\r\\nduring these operations we were all hard at it, and no hand idle but\\r\\ndicky in arms, and sally, whom he kept in full employ; but pedro, being\\r\\na sturdy lad, could drive a nail, and lift or carry the things i wanted,\\r\\nand jemmy and david, though so young, could pick up the chips, hold a\\r\\nnail or the lamp, or be some way or other useful; for i always preached\\r\\nto them the necessity of earning their bread before they ate it, and not\\r\\nthink to live on mine and their brother\\'s labour.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe nights being pretty long, after work was over, and sarah had fed her\\r\\nbrother and laid him in his hammock, we used to sit all down to enjoy\\r\\nourselves at a good meal, for we were never regular at that till night;\\r\\nand then after supper, my wife being absent, one or other of the young\\r\\nones would begin with something they had before heard me speak of, by\\r\\nsaying, \"daddy, how did you use to do this or that in england?\" then all\\r\\nears were immediately open to catch my answer, which certainly brought\\r\\non something else done either there or elsewhere; and by their little\\r\\nquestions and my answers they would sometimes draw me into a story\\r\\nof three hours long, till, perhaps, two or three of my audience were\\r\\nfalling asleep, and then we all went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\ni verily believe my children would, almost any of them, from the\\r\\nfrequent repetition of these stories, have given a sufficient account\\r\\nof england to have gained a belief from almost any englishman of their\\r\\nbeing natives there.\\r\\n\\r\\ni frequently observed, that when we had begun upon cornwall, and\\r\\ntraversed the mines, the sea-coast, or talked of the fine gentlemen\\'s\\r\\nseats, and such things, one would start up, and, if the discourse\\r\\nflagged ever so little, would cry, \"ay; but, daddy, what did you do when\\r\\nthe crocodile came after you out of the water?\" and another, before\\r\\nthat subject was half-ended (and i was forced to enter on every one they\\r\\nstarted), would be impatient for the story of the lion; and i always\\r\\ntook notice that the part each had made the most reflections on, was\\r\\nalways most acceptable to the same person: but poor sally would never\\r\\nlet the conversation drop without some account of the muletto, it was\\r\\nsuch a pretty, gentle creature, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xxvi.\\r\\n\\r\\n     the author\\'s concern at youwarkees stay--reflections on his\\r\\n     condition--hears a voice call him--youwarhee\\'s brother\\r\\n     quangrollart visits him with a companion--he treats them at\\r\\n     the grotto--the brother discovers himself by accident--\\r\\n     wilkins produces his children to him\\r\\n\\r\\nmy head, as well as my hands, had now been employed for five months in\\r\\nadjusting all things in the most suitable manner for the reception of\\r\\nyouwarkee and her friends; but nobody coming, and light days getting\\r\\nforward apace, i begin to grow very uneasy, and had formed divers\\r\\nimaginations of what might occasion her stay. thought i, i am afraid\\r\\nall the pains i have been taking will be to no purpose; for either her\\r\\nfather will not let her return, or she has of herself come to such a\\r\\nresolution; for she knows i cannot follow her, and had rather, perhaps,\\r\\nlive and enjoy the three children she has with her, amidst a number of\\r\\nher friends and acquaintance, than spend the remainder of her days with\\r\\nme and all our offspring in this solitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut then i reflected she chose it herself, or at least declared herself\\r\\nperfectly satisfied, yea, delighted therewith. and here are her children\\r\\nwith me, the major part of them; yet, what can i think? since her return\\r\\nis put off till the swangeans are over this arkoe, she will never bring\\r\\nher relations now in this unseasonable time for flight; therefore i must\\r\\nthink, if she intended to return at all, it would have been before\\r\\nnow; and as the case is not so, my fear of losing her entirely prevails\\r\\ngreatly. oh! says i, that we had but a post here as we have in england;\\r\\nthere we can communicate our thoughts at a distance to each other\\r\\nwithout any trouble, and for little charge! what a country is this to\\r\\nlive in! and what an improper creature am i to live in it! had i but\\r\\nthe graundee, i would have found her out by this time, be she where she\\r\\nwould; but, whilst every one about me can pass, repass, and act as they\\r\\nplease, i am fixed here like one of my trees, bound to the spot, or,\\r\\nupon removal, to die in the attempt. alas! why did i beget children\\r\\nhere, but to make them as wretched and inconsolable as myself! some of\\r\\nthem are so formed, indeed, as to shift for themselves; but they owe it\\r\\nto their mother, not to me. what! am i a father of children who will\\r\\nbe bound one day to curse me? severe reflection! yet i never thought of\\r\\nthis till now. but am i the only father in such a case? no, surely! for\\r\\nam not i as much bound to curse my father as my children are to curse\\r\\nme? he might have left me happy if he would; i would them if i could.\\r\\nagain, are there not others who, by improper junction with persons\\r\\ndiseased in body or vicious in mind, have entailed greater misery\\r\\nupon their posterity than i have on mine! my children are all healthy,\\r\\nstrong, and sound, both in body and mind; and is not that the greatest\\r\\nblessing that can be bestowed on our beings? but they are imprisoned\\r\\nin this arkoe! what then? with industry, here is no want; and as they\\r\\nincrease they may settle in communities, and be helpful to each other.\\r\\ni have lived here well nigh sixteen years, and it was god\\'s pleasure\\r\\ni should be here; and can i think i was placed here with an injunction\\r\\ncontrary to the great command, \"increase and multiply?\" if that were so,\\r\\ncan it be possible i should have received the only means of propagating,\\r\\nas it were, from heaven itself? no, it was certainly as much my maker\\'s\\r\\nwill that i should have posterity here, as that i myself should at first\\r\\nbe brought thither. this is a large and plentiful spot, and capable of\\r\\ngreat improvement, when there shall be hands sufficient. how many petty\\r\\nstates are less than these my dominions! i have here a compass of near\\r\\ntwenty miles round, and how many thousands grow voluntarily grey in a\\r\\nfar less circuit?\\r\\n\\r\\ni had hardly finished my reflections (for i was sitting by myself in my\\r\\ntent upon one of the trees i had turned into benches), when i heard a\\r\\nmusical voice call, \"peter! peter!\" i started. \"what\\'s this?\" says i.\\r\\n\"it is not youwarkee\\'s voice! what can this mean?\" listening, i heard it\\r\\nagain, but at so great a distance i could but just perceive the sound.\\r\\n\"be it where it will,\" says i, \"i will face it!\" thus speaking, i went\\r\\nout of the tent, and hearkened very attentively, but could hear nothing.\\r\\ni then ran for my gun, and walked through the wood as fast as i could\\r\\nto the plain; but still i neither saw nor heard anything. i was then\\r\\nin hopes of seeing somebody on the lake, but no one appeared; for i was\\r\\nfully determined to make myself known to whomsoever i should meet; and,\\r\\nif possible, to gain some intelligence of my wife. but after so much\\r\\nfruitless pains, my hopes being at an end, i was returning when i heard,\\r\\n\"peter! peter!\" again at a great distance, the sound coming from a\\r\\ndifferent quarter than at first. upon this i stopped, and heard it\\r\\nrepeated; and it was as if the speaker approached nearer and nearer.\\r\\nhereupon i stepped out of the wood (for i had just re-entered it upon\\r\\nmy return home), when i saw two persons upon the swangean just over my\\r\\nhead. i cried out, \"who\\'s that?\" and they immediately called again,\\r\\n\"peter! peter!\"--_ors clam gee_, says i; that is, here am i.--on this\\r\\nthey directly took a small sweep round (for they had overshot me before\\r\\nthey heard me) and alighted just by me; when i perceived them to be\\r\\nmy wife\\'s countrymen, being dressed like her, with vol. only broader\\r\\nchaplets about their heads, as she had told me the glumms all wore.\\r\\nafter a short obeisance, they asked me if i was the glumm peter,\\r\\nbarkett* to youwarkee. i answered i was. they then told me they\\r\\ncame with a message from pendlehamby, colamb** of arndrumn-stake, my\\r\\ngoppo,*** and from youwarkee his daughter. i was vastly rejoiced to see\\r\\nthem, and to hear only the name of my wife. but though i longed to know\\r\\ntheir message, i trembled to think of their mentioning it, as one\\r\\nof them was just going to do, for fear of hearing something very\\r\\ndispleasing; so i begged them to go through the wood with me to the\\r\\ngrotto, where we should have more leisure and convenience for talk, and\\r\\nwhere, at the same time, they might take some refreshment. but though i\\r\\nhad thus put off their message, i could not forbear inquiring by the way\\r\\nafter the health of my goppo, and my wife and children, how they got to\\r\\narndrumnstake, and how they found their relations and friends. they told\\r\\nme all were well; and that youwarkee, as she did on me, desired i would\\r\\nthink on her with true affection. i found this was the phrase of the\\r\\ncountry. as for the rest, i hoped it would turn out well at last, though\\r\\ni dreaded to hear it.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ** governor.\\r\\n\\r\\n     *** father-in-law.\\r\\n\\r\\nbeing arrived at the grotto, i desired my guests to sit down, and take\\r\\nsuch refreshment as i could prepare them. when they were seated, i went\\r\\nto work in order to provide them a repast. seeing my fire piled up very\\r\\nhigh, and burning fierce, and the children about it, they wondered where\\r\\nthey were got, and who they had come to, and turned their faces from it;\\r\\nbut i setting some chairs, so that the light might not strike on their\\r\\neyes, they liked the warmth well enough; though, i remarked, the light\\r\\ndid not affect them so much as it had done youwarkee.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhilst i was cooking, the poor children got all up in a corner, and\\r\\nstared at the strangers, not being able to conceive where they came\\r\\nfrom; and by degrees crept all backwards into the bedchamber, and hid\\r\\nthemselves; for they had never before seen anybody but my own family.\\r\\n\\r\\ni observed that one of my guests paid more than ordinary respect to the\\r\\nother; and though their graundees made no distinction between them,\\r\\nyet there was something i thought much more noble in the address and\\r\\nbehaviour of the latter; and taking notice that he was also the chief\\r\\nspokesman, i judged it proper to pay my respects to him in a somewhat\\r\\nmore distinguishing manner, though so as not to offend the other if i\\r\\nshould happen to be mistaken.\\r\\n\\r\\ni first presented a can of my madeira, and took care, as if by accident,\\r\\nto give it to mr. uppermost, as i thought him, who drank half of it,\\r\\nand would have given the remainder to his companion, but i begged him to\\r\\ndrink it all up, and his friend should be served with some presently: he\\r\\ndid so, and thanked me by lifting his hand to his chin. i then gave the\\r\\nother a can of the same liquor, which he drank, and returned thanks as\\r\\nhis companion had before. i then took a can myself, and telling them\\r\\ni begged leave to use the ceremony of my own country to them, i drank,\\r\\nwishing their own health, and that of all relations at arndrumnstake.\\r\\nhe that i took for the superior fell a-laughing heartily: \"ha, ha,\\r\\nha!\" says he, \"this is the very way my sister does every day at\\r\\narndrumnstake.\"--\"your sister, sir!\" says i, \"pray has she ever been in\\r\\neurope or england?\"--\"well!\" says he, \"i have plainly discovered myself,\\r\\nwhich i did not intend to do yet; but, truly, brother peter, i mean none\\r\\nother than your own wife youwarkee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nthe moment i knew who he was, i rose up and taking him by the right\\r\\nhand, lifted it to my lips and kissed it. he likewise immediately stood\\r\\nup, and we embraced each other with great tenderness. i then begged him,\\r\\nas i had so worthy and near a relation of my wife\\'s with me, that he\\r\\nwould not delay the happiness i hoped for, in a narrative from his\\r\\nmouth, how it fared with my father, wife, and children, and all their\\r\\nkinsfolks and friends whom i had so often heard mentioned by my dearest\\r\\nyouwarkee, and so earnestly desired to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy brother quangrollart (for that, he told me, was his name)\\r\\nwas preparing to gratify my impatience; but seeing i had set the\\r\\nentertainment on the table, which consisted chiefly of bread, several\\r\\nsorts of pickles and preserves, with some cold salted fish, he said that\\r\\neating would but interrupt the thread of his discourse; and therefore,\\r\\nwith my leave, he would defer the relating of what i desired for a\\r\\nlittle while; which we all thinking most proper, i desired him and\\r\\nhis friend (who might be another brother for aught i knew) to refresh\\r\\nthemselves with the poor modicum i was able to provide them.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhilst my brother quangrollart was looking upon and handling his plate,\\r\\nbeing what he had never before seen, his friend had got the handle\\r\\nof one of the knives in his mouth, biting it with all his force; but\\r\\nfinding he could make nothing of that end he tried the other, and got\\r\\nchamping the blade. perceiving what he was at, though i could not help\\r\\nlaughing, i rose, and begging pardon, took the knife from him; telling\\r\\nhim i believed he was not acquainted with the use of that instrument,\\r\\nwhich was one of my country implements; and that the design of it, which\\r\\nwas called a knife, and of that other (pointing to it), called a fork,\\r\\nwas the one to reduce the food into pieces proper for chewing, and the\\r\\nother to convey it to the mouth without daubing the fingers, which must\\r\\nhappen in handling the food itself; and i then showed him what use i put\\r\\nthem to, by helping each of them therewith to somewhat, and by cutting a\\r\\npiece for myself, and putting it to my mouth with the fork.\\r\\n\\r\\nthey both smiled and looked very well pleased; and then i told them\\r\\nthat the plate was the only thing that need be daubed, and when that was\\r\\ntaken away the table remained clean. so, after i had helped each of them\\r\\nfor the first time, i desired them to help themselves where they liked\\r\\nbest; and, to say the truth, they did so more dexterously than i could\\r\\nhave expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nduring our repast we had frequent sketches of the observations they made\\r\\nin their flight, and of the places where they had rested; and i could\\r\\nplainly see that neither of them had ever been at this arkoe before, by\\r\\nhinting that if they had not taken such a course they had missed me.\\r\\n\\r\\ni took particular notice which part of my entertainment they ate most\\r\\nof, that i might bring a fresh supply of that when wanted; and i found\\r\\nthat though they eat heartily of my bread and preserves, and tasted\\r\\nalmost of everything else, they never once touched the fish; which put\\r\\nme upon desiring i might help them to some. at this they looked upon\\r\\neach other, which i readily knew the meaning of, and excused themselves,\\r\\nexpressing great satisfaction in what they had already gotten. i took,\\r\\nhowever, a piece of fish on my own plate, and eating very heartily\\r\\nthereof, my brother desired me to give him a bit of it; i did so, taking\\r\\ncare to cut it as free from bones as i could, and for greater security\\r\\ncautioning him, in case there should be any, to pick them out, and not\\r\\nswallow them. he had no sooner put a piece in his mouth, but, \"rosig,\"\\r\\nsays he to his friend, \"this is padsi.\"--i thought indeed i had puzzled\\r\\nmy brother when i gave him the fish, but by what he said of it, he\\r\\npuzzled me; for i knew not what he meant by padsi, my wife having told\\r\\nme they had no fish, or else i should have taken that word for their\\r\\nname of it. however, i cut rosig a slice; and he agreeing it was padsi,\\r\\nthey both ate heartily of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhile we were at dinner, my brother told me he thought he saw some of my\\r\\nchildren just now; for his sister had informed him she had five more at\\r\\nhome; and he asked me why they did not appear and eat with us. i excused\\r\\ntheir coming, as fearing they would only be troublesome; and said, \"when\\r\\nwe had done they should have some victuals.\" but he would not be put\\r\\noff, and entreated me to admit them. so i called them by their names,\\r\\nand they came, all but dicky, who was asleep in his hammock. i told them\\r\\nthat reglumm,* pointing to quangrollart, was their uncle, their mamma\\'s\\r\\nbrother, and ordered them to pay their obeisance to him, which they\\r\\nseverally did. i then made them salute rosig. this last would have had\\r\\nthem sit down at table; but i positively forbade that; and giving each\\r\\nof them a little of what we had before us, they carried it to the chests\\r\\nand eat it there.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen we had done, the children helped me to clear the table, and were\\r\\nretiring out of the room; but then i recalled them and desired their\\r\\nuncle to excuse their stay, for as he had promised me news of their\\r\\nmammy and her family, it would be the height of pleasure to them to hear\\r\\nhim. he seemed very much pleased with this motion, desiring by all means\\r\\nthey might be present while he told his story. whereupon i ordered them\\r\\nto the chests again, while quangrollart delivered his narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nchapter xxvii.\\r\\n\\r\\n     quangrollart\\'s account of youwarkee\\'s journey, and\\r\\n     reception at her father\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nhaving set on the table some brandy and madeira, and each of us taken\\r\\none glass of both, i showed, by the attentiveness of my aspect and\\r\\nposture, how desirous i was he should proceed to what he had promised.\\r\\nobserving this, he went on in the following manner:--\"brother peter,\"\\r\\nsays he, \"my sister youwarkee, as i don\\'t doubt you will be glad to hear\\r\\nof her first, arrived very safe at arndrumnstake the third day after\\r\\nshe left you, and after a very severe flight to the dear little\\r\\nhallycarnie,* who was a full day and a night on her graundee; and at\\r\\nlast would not have been able to have reached battringdrigg but for my\\r\\nsister\\'s assistance, who, taking her sometimes on her back for a short\\r\\nflight, by those little refreshments enabled her to perform it: but from\\r\\nbattringdrigg, after some hours\\' rest, they came with pleasure to\\r\\nthe white mountains, from whence, after a small stay, they arrived at\\r\\narndrumnstake.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * one of wilkins\\' daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"they alighted at our covett,* but were opposed at their entrance by the\\r\\nguards, to whom they did not choose to discover themselves, till notice\\r\\nwas given to my father; who, upon hearing that some strangers desired\\r\\nadmittance to him, sent me to introduce them, if they were proper\\r\\npersons for his presence, or else give orders for such other reception\\r\\nas was suitable to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"when i came to the guard, i found three gawrys and a glumm boss,**\\r\\nwhose appearance and behaviour, i must own, prejudiced me very much in\\r\\ntheir favour. i then asked from whence they came, and their business\\r\\nwith the colamb. you-warkee told me they came not about business of\\r\\npublic concern, relating to the colamb\\'s office, but out of a dutiful\\r\\nregard, as relations, to kiss his knees.--\\'my father\\' said i, \\'shall\\r\\nknow it immediately; but first, pray inform me of your name?\\'--\\'your\\r\\nfather!\\' replied youwarkee; \\'are you my brother quangrollart?\\'--\\'my name\\r\\nis so,\\' says i, \\'but i have only one sister, now with my father, and\\r\\nhow i can be your brother, i am not able to guess.\\'--\\'have you never had\\r\\nanother sister?\\' says she.--\\'yes,\\' says i, \\'but she is long since dead;\\r\\nher name was youwarkee.\\' at my mentioning her name, she fell upon\\r\\nmy neck in tears, crying, \\'my dear brother, i am that dead sister\\r\\nyouwarkee, and these with me are some of my children, for i have five\\r\\nmore; but, pray, how does my father and sister?\\'--i started back at this\\r\\ndeclaration, to view her and the children, fearing it was some gross\\r\\nimposition, not in the least knowing or remembering anything of her\\r\\nface, after so long an absence; but i desired them to walk in, till i\\r\\ntold my father.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * capital seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ** youth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"the guard observing the several passages between us, were amazed to\\r\\nthink who it could be had so familiarly embraced me; especially as they\\r\\nsaw i only played a passive part in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"when i went in, i did not think proper directly to inform my father\\r\\nwhat had happened; but calling my sister hallycarnie, i let her into\\r\\nthe circumstances of this odd affair, and desired her advice what to do:\\r\\n\\'for,\\' says i, \\'surely this must be some impostor; and as my father has\\r\\nscarce subdued his sorrow for my sister\\'s loss, if this gawry should\\r\\nprove a deceiver, it will only revive his affliction, and may prove at\\r\\nthis time extremely dangerous to him: therefore let us consider what had\\r\\nbest be done in the matter.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"hallycarnie, who had attentively weighed all i said, seemed to think\\r\\nit was some cheat, as well as i did; for we could neither of us conceive\\r\\nthat anything but death, or being slit, could have kept youwarkee so\\r\\nlong from the knowledge of her relations; and that neither of them could\\r\\nbe the case was plain, if the person attending was youwarkee. \\'besides,\\r\\nbrother,\\' says hallycarnie, \\'she cannot surely be so much altered in\\r\\nfifteen years, but you must have known her; and yet, now i think, it is\\r\\npossible, you being so much younger, may have forgot her; but whilst we\\r\\nhave been talking of her, i have so well recollected her, that i think i\\r\\ncould hardly be imposed upon by any deceiver.\\' \"i then desired her to\\r\\ngo with me to the strangers and see if she could make any discovery. she\\r\\ndid so, and had no sooner entered the abb,* but youwarkee called\\r\\nout, \\'my dear sister hally-carnie!\\' and she as readily recollecting\\r\\nyouwarkee, they in transport embraced each other; and then your wife\\r\\npresenting to us her three children, it proved the tenderest scene,\\r\\nexcept the following, i ever saw.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"my father having kept his chamber some time with a fever, and though he\\r\\nwas pretty well recovered, having not yet been out of it, we consulted\\r\\nhow we might introduce our sister and children to him, with as little\\r\\nsurprise as might be, for fear of a relapse by too great a hurry of his\\r\\nspirits. at length we concluded i should go tell him that some strangers\\r\\nhad arrived desiring to see him; but on inquiry, finding their business\\r\\nwas too trifling to trouble him upon, i had despatched them; i was then\\r\\nto say how like one of them was to my sister youwarkee; and whilst i was\\r\\nspeaking, hallycarnie was to enter, and keep up the discourse till we\\r\\nshould find a proper opportunity of discovery. i went in, therefore, as\\r\\nhad been agreed; and upon mentioning the name of youwarkee, my father\\r\\nfetched a deep sigh and turned away from me in tears. at that instant\\r\\nhallycarnie came in as by accident. \\'sir,\\' says she, \\'what makes you so\\r\\nsad? are you worse to-day?\\'--\\'oh,\\' says he, \\'i have heard a name that\\r\\nwill never be out of my heart, till i am in hoximo.\\'*--\\'what, i suppose\\r\\nmy sister?\\'--\\'\\'tis true,\\' replied he, \\'the same.\\'--says she, \\'i fancied\\r\\nso, for i have just seen a stranger as like her as two dorrs** could be,\\r\\nand would have sworn it was she, if that had been possible. i thought my\\r\\nbrother had been so imprudent as to mention her to you; and i think he\\r\\ndid not do well to rip up an old sore he knew was almost healed, and\\r\\nmake it break out afresh.\\'--\\'ah! no, child,\\' says my father, \\'that sore\\r\\nnever has, nor can be healed. o great image! why can\\'t it by some means\\r\\nor other be ascertained what end she came to?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n     * a place where the dead are buried.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ** a fruit like an apple.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'sir,\\' says my sister, \\'i think you are much to blame for these\\r\\nexclamations, after so long absence; for, if she be dead, what use are\\r\\nthey of? and if she be not, all may be well, and you may still see her\\r\\nagain.\\'--\\'oh, never, never!\\' says my father; \\'but could i be sure she\\r\\nwas alive, i would take a swangean and never close my graundee till i\\r\\nfound her, or dropt dead in the search.\\'--\\'and suppose you could meet\\r\\nwith her, sir,\\' says i, \\'the very sight would overcome you, and be\\r\\ndangerous.\\' \\'no, believe me, boy,\\' says he, \\'i should then be fully easy\\r\\nand composed; and were she to come in this moment, i should suffer no\\r\\nsurprise, but pleasure.\\'--\\'no surprise, sir?\\' says i.--\\'not if she were\\r\\nalive and well,\\' says he.--\\'then, sir,\\' says hallycarnie, \\'will you\\r\\nexcuse me if i introduce her?\\' and went out directly without staying for\\r\\nan answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"when she was gone, \\'quangrollart,\\' says my father sternly, \\'what is the\\r\\nmeaning of yours and your sister\\'s playing thus upon my weakness? it is\\r\\nwhat i can upon no account forgive. it looks as if you were weary of\\r\\nme, and wanted to break my heart. to what purpose is all this prelude of\\r\\nyours, to introduce to me somebody, who, by her likeness to my daughter,\\r\\nmay expose me to your scoff and raillery? this is a disobedience i never\\r\\nexpected from either of you.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'the great image attend me!\\' says i; \\'sir, you have much mistaken me;\\r\\nbut i will not leave you in doubt, even till hallycarnie\\'s return. you\\r\\nshall see youwarkee with her; for all our discourse, i\\'ll assure you,\\r\\nhas but been concerted to prepare you for her reception, with three of\\r\\nher children.\\' \\'and am i then, says he, in a transport, \\'still to be\\r\\nblessed?\\'--\\'you are, sir,\\' says i, \\'assure yourself you are.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"by this time we heard them coming, but my poor father had not power to\\r\\ngo to meet them: and upon youwarkee\\'s nearer approach, to fall at his\\r\\nknees, his limbs failing him, he sunk, and without speaking a word, fell\\r\\nbackwards on a cught drappec,* which stood behind him; and, being quite\\r\\nmotionless, we concluded him to be stone-dead. on this the women\\r\\nbecame entirely helpless, screaming only, and wringing their hands in\\r\\nextravagant postures. but i, having a little more presence of mind,\\r\\ncalled for the calentar;** who, by holding his nose, pinching his feet,\\r\\nand other applications, in a little time brought him to his senses\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n     * a bed or couch covered with a sort of cotton.\\r\\n\\r\\n     ** a sort of doctor in all great families.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"you may more easily conceive than i describe, both the confusion we\\r\\nwere all in during my father\\'s disorder, and the congratulations upon\\r\\nhis recovery; so, as i can give you but a defective account of these,\\r\\ni shall pass them by, and come to our more serious discourse, after my\\r\\nfather and your wife had, without speaking a word, wept themselves quite\\r\\ndry on each other\\'s necks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"my father, then looking upon the three children (who were also crying\\r\\nto see their mamma cry), \\'and who are these?\\' says he.--\\'these, sir,\\'\\r\\nsays youwarkee, \\'are three of eight of your grandchildren.\\'--\\'and where\\r\\nis your barkett?\\' says he. \\'at home with the rest, sir,\\' replied she,\\r\\n\\'who are some of them too small to come so far yet; but, sir,\\' says she,\\r\\n\\'pray excuse my answering you any more questions, till you are a little\\r\\nrecovered from the commotion i perceive my presence has brought upon\\r\\nyour spirits; and as rest, the calentar says, will be exceedingly\\r\\nproper, i will retire with my sister till you are better able to bear\\r\\ncompany.\\' my father was with much difficulty prevailed with to part\\r\\nwith her out of his sight: but the calentar pressing it, we were all\\r\\ndismissed, and he laid down to rest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nmy brother would have gone on, but i told him, as it grew near time for\\r\\nrepose, and he and rosig must needs be fatigued with so long a flight,\\r\\nif they pleased (as i had already heard the most valuable part of all\\r\\nhe could say, in that my father had received my wife and children so\\r\\nkindly, and that he left them all well) we could defer his farther\\r\\nrelation till the next day; which they both agreeing to, i laid them in\\r\\nmy own bed, myself sleeping in a spare hammock.\\r\\n\\r\\nend of vol. i.\\r\\n\\r\\nprinted by ballantyne, hanson and co. edinburgh and london.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nend of the project gutenberg ebook of life and adventures of peter wilkins,\\r\\nvol. i.

be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the irs.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united\\r\\nstates.  compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  we do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  to\\r\\nsend donations or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit

concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the united states.  u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nplease check the project gutenberg web pages for current
